from the author of utopia for realists  a revolutionary argument that the innate goodness and cooperation of human beings has been the greatest factor in our successif one basic principle has served as the bedrock of bestselling author rutger bregman s thinking  it is that every progressive idea    whether it was the abolition of slavery  the advent of democracy  women s suffrage  or the ratification of marriage equality    was once considered radical and dangerous by the mainstream opinion of its time  with humankind  he brings that mentality to bear against one of our most entrenched ideas  namely  that human beings are by nature selfish and self interested by providing a new historical perspective of the last 200 000 years of human history  bregman sets out to prove that we are in fact evolutionarily wired for cooperation rather than competition  and that our instinct to trust each other has a firm evolutionary basis going back to the beginning of homo sapiens  bregman systematically debunks our understanding of the milgram electrical shock experiment  the zimbardo prison experiment  and the kitty genovese  bystander effect  in place of these  he offers little known true stories  the tale of twin brothers on opposing sides of apartheid in south africa who came together with nelson mandela to create peace  a group of six shipwrecked children who survived for a year and a half on a deserted island by working together  a study done after world war ii that found that as few as 15  of american soldiers were actually capable of firing at the enemy the ultimate goal of humankind is to demonstrate that while neither capitalism nor communism has on its own been proven to be a workable social system  there is a third option  giving  citizens and professionals the means  left  to make their own choices  right    reorienting our thinking toward positive and high expectations of our fellow man  bregman argues  will reap lasting success  bregman presents this idea with his signature wit and frankness  once again making history  social science and economic theory accessible and enjoyable for lay readers,book description

the real danger is not what happens to your data as it crosses the net  argues analyst bill thompson  it is what happens when it arrives at the other end  the financial services authority has warned banks and other financial institutions that members of criminal gangs may be applying for jobs which give them access to confidential customer data  the fear is not that they will steal money from our bank accounts but that they will instead steal something far more valuable in our digital society   our identities  armed with the personal details that a bank holds  plus a fake letter or two  it is apparently easy to get a loan  open a bank account with an overdraft or get a credit card in someone else s name  and it is then a simple matter to move the money into another account and leave the unwitting victim to sort out the mess when statements and demands for payment start arriving  identity theft is an increasingly significant economic crime  and we are all becoming more aware of the dangers of leaving bills  receipts and bank statements unshredded in our rubbish  but  however careful you may be  if the organisations you trust with your personal data  bank accounts and credit cards are not able to look after their databases properly then you are in trouble  it is surprising that it has taken the gangs so long to realise that a well placed insider is by far the simplest way to break the security of a computer system  in fact  i suspect that the fsa is probably very late to this particular party and that this sort of thing has been going on for rather a long time  has anyone checked bob cratchit s family links to the criminal underworld  i wonder  and it is hardly likely to be only banks that are being targeted  health authorities  government agencies and of course the big e commerce sites like amazon must also offer rich pickings for the fraudsters  the good news is that better auditing is likely to catch out those who access account details that they are not supposed to  and as we all become aware of the danger of identity theft and look more carefully for unexpected transactions on our statements  banks should have good enough records and logs to trace the people who might have accessed the account details  fortunately there are now ways to keep bank systems more secure fro,news article

it s become commonplace to argue that blair and brown are like squabbling school kids and that they  and their supporters  need to grow up and stop bickering  but this analysis in fact gets it wrong  it s not just children who fight   adults do too  and there are solid reasons why even a trivial argument between mature protagonists can be hard to stop once its got going  the key feature of an endless feud is that everyone can agree they d be better off if it ended   but everyone wants to have the last word  each participant genuinely wants the row to stop  but thinks it worth prolonging the argument just a tiny bit to ensure their view is heard  their successive attempts to end the argument with their last word ensure the argument goes on and on and on   in the case of mr blair and mr brown  successive books are published  ensuring the issues never die   now this isn t because the participants are stupid   it s actually each individual behaving entirely rationally  given the incentives facing them  indeed  there s even a piece of economic theory that explains all this  nothing as obscure as  post neo classical endogenous growth theory  which the chancellor himself once quoted   but a ubiquitous piece of game theory which all respectable policy wonks are familiar with  it s often referred to as the  prisoner s dilemma   based on a parable much told in economics degree courses    about a sheriff and two prisoners  the story goes that two prisoners are jointly charged with a heinous crime  and are locked up in separate cells  but the sheriff desperately needs a confession from at least one of them  to provide enough evidence to convict them of the crime  without a confession  the prisoners will get a minimal sentence on some trumped up charge  clearly the prisoners  best strategy is to keep their mouths shut  and take the short sentence  but the clever sheriff has an idea to induce them to talk  he tells each prisoner separately  that if they confess   and they are the only one to confess   they ll be let off their crime  and he tells them that if they don t confess   and they are the only one not to confess   they ll get life  now  if you are prisoner confronted with this choice  your best bet is to confess  if your partner doesn t confess  you ll get off completely  and if,news article

a team of us researchers has shown that controlling devices with the brain is a step closer  four people  two of them partly paralysed wheelchair users  successfully moved a computer cursor while wearing a cap with 64 electrodes  previous research has shown that monkeys can control a computer with electrodes implanted into their brain  the new york team reported their findings in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences   the results show that people can learn to use scalp recorded electroencephalogram rhythms to control rapid and accurate movement of a cursor in two directions   said jonathan wolpaw and dennis mcfarlane  the research team  from new york state department of health and state university of new york in albany  said the research was another step towards people controlling wheelchairs or other electronic devices by thought  the four people faced a large video screen wearing a special cap which  meant no surgery or implantation was needed  brain activity produces electrical signals that can be read by electrodes  complex algorithms then translate those signals into instructions to direct the computer  such brain activity does not require the use of any nerves of muscles  so people with stroke or spinal cord injuries could use the cap effectively   the impressive non invasive multidimensional control achieved in the present study suggests that a non invasive brain control interface could support clinically useful operation of a robotic arm  a motorised wheelchair or a neuroprosthesis   said the researchers  the four volunteers also showed that they could get better at controlling the cursor the more times they tried  although the two partially paralysed people performed better overall  the researchers said this could be because their brains were more used to adapting or that they were simply more motivated  it is not the first time researchers have had this sort of success in brain control experiments  some teams have used eye motion and other recording techniques  earlier this year  a team at the mit media labs europe demonstrated a wireless cap which read brain waves to control a computer character,news article

this third harry potter film brought a change of director and a dramatic visual shake up that really shines on dvd  gone are the warm  bright colours found in the two earlier films  alfonso cuaron brings in a bleak and cold feel that is simply gorgeous   and looks even better here than in the cinema  it is all part of the progression of harry s story into darker areas  but you ll spend time just marvelling at the beautiful hogwarts landscape  this is the first potter film where you get so lost in the screen adaptation that you forget the book  it is the third year at hogwarts and studies are interrupted  as they always are  by a calamity that only harry  ron and hermione can put right  it sounds corny  but harry is no longer the winsome hero  he is a moody teenager and daniel radcliffe pulls it off very well  emma watson is ever better as hermione  and the young stars are joined by the usual myriad famous actors including gary oldman and emma thompson  the film itself is the reason to buy this dvd  but it is laden with behind the scenes extras  including funny  if shallow  interviews with all the main cast  but what seems like a long list of features can be swiftly whittled down to the few that you are going to watch  younger viewers will go for the games which include a magic you may have missed memory test  and crookshanks chasing off after scabbers  adult viewers will ignore those and go straight to the deleted scenes  you will understand why they were deleted but it is fun to see more footage   and not have to hunt through endless menus to find it  as we did on the first harry potter dvd  the most interesting pieces are an interview with jk rowling in creating the vision and conjuring a scene  a short featurette about the making of the film s big moments,news article

a contentious campaign to bump up the bandwidth bills of spammers by flooding their sites with data has been dropped  lycos europe s make love  not spam campaign began in late november but its tactics proved controversial  lycos has shut down the campaign saying it had been started to stimulate debate about anti spam measures and had now achieved this aim  the anti spammer screensaver came under fire for encouraging vigilante activity and skirting the edge of the law  through the make love  not spam website  users could download a screensaver that would endlessly request data from the net sites mentioned in many junk mail messages  more than 100 000 people are thought to have downloaded the screensaver that lycos europe offered  the company wanted to keep the spam sites running at near total capacity to make it much less financially attractive to spammers to operate the sites  but the campaign was controversial from the moment it kicked off and many net veterans criticised it for using spamming type tactics against the senders of junk mail  some net service firms began blocking access to the lycos europe site in protest at the action  monitoring firm netcraft found that the anti spam campaign was proving a little too successful  according to response time figures gathered by netcraft  some of the sites that the screensaver targeted were being knocked offline by the constant data requests  in a statement from lycos europe announcing the scrapping of the scheme  the company denied that this was its fault   there is nothing to suggest that make love  not spam has brought down any of the sites that it has targeted   it said   at the time that netcraft measured the sites it claims may have been brought down  they were not in fact part of the make love  not spam attack cycle   it added  the statement issued by lycos also said that the centralised database it used ensured that traffic to the target sites left them with 5  spare capacity   the idea was simply to slow spammers  sites and this was achieved by the campaign   the company said  many security organisations said users should not participate in the lycos europe campaign  the closure comes only days after the campaign was suspended following the outbreak of criticism,news article

a cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet  the elections watchdog has said  fears that big donors can buy political favours have sparked calls for a limit  in a new report  the electoral commission says it is worth debating a £10 000 cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it  it also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning  there were almost £68m in reported donations to political parties in 2001  2002 and 2003  with nearly £12m of them from individual gifts worth more than £1m  the rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions  the commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash   something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work   while we are not in principle opposed to the introduction of a donation cap  we do not believe that such a major departure from the existing system now would be sensible   says its report  if there was to be a cap  it should be £10 000   a small enough amount to make a difference but which would have banned £56m in donations between 2001 and 2003  even without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more small scale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under £200  it also suggests increasing state funding for parties to £3m so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the house of commons  european parliament  scottish parliament  welsh assembly or northern ireland assembly  and it suggests new ways of boosting election campaigning  seen as a way of improving voter turnout  all local election candidates should be entitled to a free mailshot for campaign leaflets  says the watchdog  and there should be a shift in the amount of money allowed to be spent at elections from a national level to a local level to help politicians engage better with voters  the report suggests doubling the money which can be spent by candidates  while cutting national spending limits from £20m to £15m  the commission also says the spending limits for general elections should cover the four months bef,news article

you can now buy  trusted computers   but can we really trust the pc vendors  asks technology analyst bill thompson  if you have recently bought an ibm thinkvantage computer  a dell optiplex  or one of a whole range of laptops from toshiba  hp compaq or samsung then you may have got more for your money than you realised  inside your shiny new pc is an extra chip called the trusted platform module  tpm  that can be used for a range of hardware based security features  eventually the tpm will be built into the main processor itself  and if the trusted computing group has its way then you will find one in every piece of hardware you own  from mobile phones to tv set top boxes to children s toys  but for the moment it is a separate piece of hardware  providing enhanced security features to programs that know how to use them  and as part of a well designed network system  it can provide a lot more security than we enjoy today  a big advantage of the tpm is that it is hardware based  at the moment most of us rely on software to keep our information safe and secure  it might be password protected user accounts  data encryption programs or a firewall  but it all relies on program code running on an inherently insecure processor  hardware security is less common  even if it is a lot safer  this is partly because it is more expensive to give someone a smartcard than a password  but also because its more work for users  systems administrators and managers  as a result we settle for second best  so when it comes to computer security  trusted systems could be a major step forward  after all  if you have a laptop that will only run programs that have been digitally signed then it will be a lot harder for virus writers to get their malicious code to run  and if all your files are locked automatically then even if you get your computer stolen your personal data will be safeguarded  at the moment support for trusted hardware is not built into major operating systems  instead you have to use special software  like hp s protecttools or wave systems  embassy  this provides file encryption  password management and identity protection  usually for business users who connect to company networks  full support for the trusted computing specification will not be available from microsoft until the n,news article

the first minister s statement that it was okay to get drunk  once in a while  has diverted attention from the real issues  it has been claimed  jack law  chief executive of alcohol focus scotland  said jack mcconnell s comment was  ill advised   the media attention had helped to move the focus from scotland s binge drinking problems  mr law said  scotsman journalist hamish macdonell said he believed the bigger picture had been  obscured  by the remark  mr mcconnell was speaking on monday to more than 100 secondary pupils from schools in the highlands about the problems of binge drinking and drink promotions  the one sentence comment was immediately criticised by the scottish national party which accused him of encouraging young people to get drunk  but the scottish executive has insisted mr mcconnell was speaking about adults and his comments were  a recognition that people will get drunk   mr macdonell  political editor of the scotsman  said   i think we have to say right at the outset that this was a very stupid and ill advised remark by the first minister   if you come out with something like this  saying that by all means get drunk  then you will be pilloried for it   however  he added that  perhaps mr mcconnell could feel rightly aggrieved about the coverage   mr macdonell said   i think the problem here is that he did say a lot more things about binge drinking and under age drinking   but that whole side of things has been lost in the furore over one sentence  i understand why  but i think there is a much bigger message here that has been obscured   mr law  from voluntary body alcohol focus scotland  believed damage had been done to scotland s fight against binge drinking  he said he accepted that young people drank and they did have problems with drink  mr law added   i think the remark was ill advised   but these remarks are blown out of all proportion and they so easily misrepresent what we are trying to do in scotland   we don t want to preach to young people  but we need to acknowledge that they do drink problematically   this diverts us from the real issues which are about promoting responsibility and reducing harm and indeed tackling our drinking culture which is a culture about binge drinking and drunkenness   he said it was vital that young people were pro,news article

a failed government scheme to offer uk university courses online has been branded a  disgraceful waste  by mps  the e university was scrapped last year  having attracted only 900 students at a cost of £50m  chief executive john beaumont was paid a bonus of £44 914  despite a failure to bring in private sector backers  the commons education select committee called this  morally indefensible  but the government said the e university project had  improved understanding   a department for education and skills spokeswoman said the venture had been  ambitious and ground breaking  but take up had not been  sufficient to continue with the project   she added   uk e universities was not the only organisation to have lost out on private sector investment in the collapse of the dotcom boom   the select committee found that those responsible for founding the e university in 2000 had been caught up in the  general atmosphere of enthusiasm  surrounding the internet  initial business plans forecast a quarter of a million students joining within a decade  bringing in at least £110m in profit  but virtually no market research was carried out and just £4 2m was spent on worldwide sales and marketing of courses  some £14m went on developing the technology to make the e university work  this was used by just 200 students  the rest preferring to work through existing university websites  with no significant private investors and no direct accountability to a government minister  the e university had had  too much freedom to spend public money as it wished   the report found  committee chairman barry sheerman said   uk e university was a terrible waste of public money   the senior executives failed to interest any private investors and showed an extraordinary over confidence in their ability to attract students to the scheme   the report warns that the government should not be scared off investment in innovative but potentially risky schemes by the failure of the e university  but  should learn the lessons from this disaster,news article

chelsea manager jose mourinho expects the champions league clash with barcelona to be a fight to the finish  mourinho is relishing the first leg of the tie against his former club in the last 16 in the nou camp  he said   i wouldn t be surprised if nothing had been decided by the last minute of the return leg and the match had to go into extra time   i have to defend what is mine and the champions league is mine at the moment  i m the last manager to have won it   mourinho never coached barcelona  assisting both sir bobby robson and louis van gaal  but he is not envious  insisting   i don t have to be jealous about barcelona because they have 100 years of history and have won the european cup once   i have been managing for five years and i have the same amount of champions league trophies to my name   barcelona star ronaldinho admitted   i think that it is going to be a difficult match for us because chelsea have a good team full of big stars   i have seen chelsea a few times on television  tactically they are very good and they are very strong on the counter attack   they pressure very well and keep possession of the ball so it will be important that we play our own game   i believe they are the two strongest teams in europe  nevertheless  barcelona are accustomed to playing big games at the nou camp  where they have to face the likes of real madrid each season   it is a special game  the atmosphere in the city changes  there are lots of journalists but inside the dressing room there is not a lot of difference   ronaldinho added   we are only thinking of winning the match with all respect to the opposition,news article

in this groundbreaking historical exposé  douglas a  blackmon brings to light one of the most shameful chapters in american history—an “age of neoslavery” that thrived from the aftermath of the civil war through the dawn of world war ii under laws enacted specifically to intimidate blacks  tens of thousands of african americans were arbitrarily arrested  hit with outrageous fines  and charged for the costs of their own arrests  with no means to pay these ostensible “debts ” prisoners were sold as forced laborers to coal mines  lumber camps  brickyards  railroads  quarries  and farm plantations  thousands of other african americans were simply seized by southern landowners and compelled into years of involuntary servitude  government officials leased falsely imprisoned blacks to small town entrepreneurs  provincial farmers  and dozens of corporations—including u s  steel—looking for cheap and abundant labor  armies of “free” black men labored without compensation  were repeatedly bought and sold  and were forced through beatings and physical torture to do the bidding of white masters for decades after the official abolition of american slavery the neoslavery system exploited legal loopholes and federal policies that discouraged prosecution of whites for continuing to hold black workers against their wills  as it poured millions of dollars into southern government treasuries  the new slavery also became a key instrument in the terrorization of african americans seeking full participation in the u s  political system based on a vast record of original documents and personal narratives  slavery by another name unearths the lost stories of slaves and their descendants who journeyed into freedom after the emancipation proclamation and then back into the shadow of involuntary servitude  it also reveals the stories of those who fought unsuccessfully against the re emergence of human labor trafficking  the modern companies that profited most from neoslavery  and the system’s final demise in the 1940s  partly due to fears of enemy propaganda about american racial abuse at the beginning of world war ii slavery by another name is a moving  sobering account of a little known crime against african americans  and the insidious legacy of racism that reverberates today,book description

murder sentences should not be reduced automatically simply because of a guilty plea  says a new mps  report  the influential commons home affairs committee was responding to sentencing guidelines issued this summer  the mps also call for tougher sentences for crimes committed under the influence of drink or drugs  they say the influence of drugs and alcohol should be introduced as an aggravating factor when judges and magistrates sentence offenders  committee chairman john denham said drugs of alcohol were sometimes used as an excuse   the committee believes that these arguments should be rejected by sentencers and that being under their influence should instead be an aggravating factor   at present judges  when sentencing murderers to the mandatory life sentence  can reduce the tariff   the minimum term they must serve   if the defendant pleads guilty  but although they are spared the ordeal of a trial many murder victims  relatives are unhappy  in july this year amanda champion s killer  james ford  pleaded guilty to her murder and was jailed for at least 15 years   it would have been longer had he denied the charge  amanda s uncle  lewis champion  told the bbc news website ford did not deserve any credit for his plea  saying   nothing at all is worth taking five years off a murder sentence   mps criticised home secretary david blunkett last year for introducing last minute rules allowing reduced sentences for murderers who pleaded guilty  the measures passed into law virtually unnoticed after mr blunkett introduced them at a late stage of the criminal justice bill  as a result  says the committee  the government may need to re legislate to  remove ambiguity  over how murderers should be sentenced  it is also calling on the senior judge in england and wales  lord woolf  to abandon draft guidelines he proposed in september to reduce sentences of murderers who plead guilty  the committee said the plans had not reflected the  public disquiet  expressed over the possibility of significantly reduced prison terms for murderers  lord woolf s sentencing guidelines council  sgc  caused further controversy by suggesting a one third discount off sentences for early guilty pleas in all types of crime  as a result murderers who face a 15 year tariff could get five years knocked off,news article

ten years of  golden  economic performance may come to an end in 2005 with growth slowing markedly  city consultancy deloitte has warned  the uk economy could suffer a backlash from the slowdown in the housing market  triggering a fall in consumer spending and a rise in unemployment  deloitte is forecasting economic growth of 2  this year  below chancellor gordon brown s forecast of 3  to 3 5   it also believes that interest rates will fall to 4  by the end of the year  in its quarterly economic review  deloitte said the uk economy had enjoyed a  golden period  during the past decade with unemployment falling to a near 30 year low and inflation at its lowest since the 1960s  but it warned that this growth had been achieved at the expense of creating major  imbalances  in the economy  deloitte s chief economic advisor roger bootle said   the biggest hit of all is set to come from the housing market which has already embarked on a major slowdown   whereas the main driver of the economy in recent years has been robust household spending growth  this is likely to suffer as the housing market slowdown gathers pace   economic growth is likely to be constrained during the next few years by increased pressure on household budgets and rising taxes  deloitte believes  gordon brown will need to raise about  10bn a year in order to sustain the public finances in the short term  the firm claims  this will result in a marked slowdown in growth in 2005 and 2006 compared to last year  when the economy expanded by 3 25   however  deloitte stressed that the slowdown was unlikely to have any major impact on retail prices while it expected the bank of england to respond quickly to signs of the economy faltering  it expects a series of  aggressive  interest rate cuts over the next two years  with the cost of borrowing falling from its current 4 75  mark to 3 5  by the end of 2006   although 2005 may not be the year when things go completely wrong  it will probably mark the start of a more difficult period for the uk economy   mr bootle,news article

millions of the world s poorest textile trade workers will lose their jobs under new trade rules to be introduced in the new year  a charity has warned  the world trade organisation  wto  is to end its multi fibre agreement  mfa  on midnight of 31 december  christian aid condemned the move  saying it would see almost a million jobs in bangladesh alone being axed  however  supporters of the change claim it will mean increased efficiency and lower costs for western consumers  it will also see more jobs created in india and china  advocates argue  the wto said that many developing countries support the end of quotas and stressed that funding was available to countries such as bangladesh to help them make the transition to a fully liberalised market   there will be a period of adjustment required   said wto spokesman keith rockwell   some countries will do better than others but there is no one who is suggesting that no developing country will do well out of this   some countries where it may appear that orders will dry up have seen orders surging and there are many companies who will continue with existing trading relationships   christian aid has called on british firms not to simply  cut and run  but look after their workers  in a new report called rags to riches to rags  it added that with few employment alternatives available many sacked garment workers could end up in far worse jobs   with some of the mainly female workers forced into the sex trade  the wto itself has warned that as many as 27 million jobs could be lost as a result of liberalisation in the textile industry  some of the world s fastest developing countries which rely on textile exports to build growth   for example in bangladesh textiles account for almost 85  of the country s exports and the industry employs around 1 5 million people  the mfa pact has helped developing countries get a bigger share of the world market   the losers in this new trade landscape will be some of the most vulnerable workers in countries such as bangladesh  cambodia  sri lanka and nepal   andrew pendleton  christian aid s head of trade policy  said   they will be hard pressed to cope when garment industries there lose their protection   we are deeply concerned that the new year will spell misery for huge numbers of garment work,news article

former blackburn boss roy hodgson says the premiership should follow the rest of europe and have a winter break   but insists that a gruelling domestic schedule will not damage the english elite s bid for champions league glory  hodgson   now in charge at viking stavanger   was at liverpool s clash with bayer leverkusen at anfield on tuesday as a member of uefa s technical committee  hodgson is a fierce advocate of the winter break employed throughout europe  although not in england   where the champions league contenders have ploughed through a heavy fixture list  but hodgson told bbc sport that while he believes the premiership should embrace the idea  he does not expect it to cost the english representatives in the last 16 of the champions league   i just feel it is very difficult to say with certainty that teams who have had the break will have a definite edge   i am a fervent supporter of the break  it gives players the chance to recharge their batteries midway through the season  which some suggest will give teams an advantage in the champions league   the other school of thought suggests having a break then coming back to it puts you at a disadvantage   the bigger discussions around the winter break should be to do with the nature of football today  the needs of football players and the way the premiership has developed  rather than one or two matches in the champions league in february   hodgson believes a winter break carries many advantages  explaining   as i said  it is the perfect chance to recharge batteries   and certainly if i was still a manager in england i would be supporting any calls for its introduction   in pre season you get a lot of enthusiasm and energy but by the time you get towards christmas many players  having also played plenty of international matches for club and country and travelled a lot  find themselves getting very jaded   the break gives them a chance to recover that energy and enthusiasm and  perhaps more importantly  recover their mental strength during the break and get ready for the games ahead   the mental side is by far the most important thing   hodgson added   the length of breaks can vary  in italy the break was very short  you just took christmas and new year   it was so short you didn t do anything  you gave the players a,news article
for an international manager  a friendly provides an important opportunity to work with your players  the only problem is that the game itself can often be a farce  some people have been saying it would be better to get the players together for the week  and do away with the 90 minutes at the end  i would say it s 50 50 whether you should have these games or not  and if you look at it that way you would probably say you re better not doing so  it would certainly keep club managers happy  as it would reduce the risk of players returning to domestic duty injured  but international bosses will tell you that scrapping friendlies is counterproductive because the only way for a team to get better is by playing  the more you play together  the easier it is when it comes to the crunch in games like world cup quarter finals against brazil  often in friendlies  though  a manager will play his strongest side for the first 45 minutes and then send out an entirely different one in the second half  and it s very difficult for any player to come on as substitute in a side with a few changes  let alone a whole team s worth  the debate will rage on  and i m not sure there is a satisfactory solution  one manager who has got it right this week is walter smith  the new scotland manager has decided to have a training camp instead of a friendly for his first international week since replacing berti vogts  it is the sort of move you would expect from walter  who is a canny manager  the players have had such a hard time recently that he is better off getting them together in a relaxed atmosphere and trying to generate some team spirit before the next world cup qualifiers  if he had sent them out on wednesday and they had been badly beaten  it would have done them no good whatsoever  john toshack has his first game in charge of wales  and it will be important for him to get a decent result against hungary  he will have his own ideas on individuals and how to play and will probably look more at the performance  but the public wants results  it s extremely difficult to get the balance for friendlies  if you win  people forget them  but if you lose it becomes a stat that can be used against you  england s game against holland is a good example  it looks like a good opportunity to try out players lik,news article

the conservative party would cut the number of mps by about one fifth if they were elected  tory leader michael howard has said  the plan forms part of the party s  smaller government bill   to be unveiled later this week  mr howard told the sunday times the party would also reduce the number of government special advisers  and he said a referendum would be held in wales to decide whether or not to scrap the welsh assembly  the changes would all take place within five years of the conservatives winning a general election  mr howard told the paper  the precise number of mps to go would depend on the result of the welsh referendum  but it would probably mean a reduction of around 120 from the current total of 659  if wales decided to keep its assembly it would stand to lose more mps  mr howard said as both parties planned to cut the number of civil servants at whitehall   labour by more than 80 000 and the tories by almost 100 000   they should accept a similar drop in their own numbers   it is all very well saying government departments should be reduced  but what about ministers  parliament and special advisers   he said  shadow leader of the commons oliver heald said   this will be part of our aim to reduce unnecessary and costly interference in people s lives by reducing the size and role of the state   mr howard said the plan would also even out the  great unfairness  of there being proportionately more scottish and welsh mps at westminster than those from england  the average size of an english constituency was 70 000 people  mr howard said  in northern ireland it was just over 66 000  in wales just over 59 000 and in scotland 53 000  the number of welsh mps would be set at an amount that was  consistent and fair in terms of representation with the rest of the united kingdom  if the assembly was scrapped  mr howard said the changes should be carried out quickly and could even be implemented by the election after next   you have got to have a big bang  we don t want this like the house of lords reform  getting to one stage and then not having the next stage,news article

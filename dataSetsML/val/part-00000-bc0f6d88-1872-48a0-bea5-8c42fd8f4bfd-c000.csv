david blunkett has apologised to mps after the home office announced  prematurely  via press release a review of murder laws  the home secretary confirmed the review was to get under way in the wake of a law commission report which branded the current murder law as  a mess   he said the review would look at partial defences to murder  including provocation and at mandatory sentences  the home office has already said the review will begin next year  on wednesday  a home office spokeswoman said the terms of reference for the review had not been established but it was likely to include only england and wales  news of the review was released because it was thought mr blunkett would make the official announcement in a commons debate on wednesday  but the announcement never came  with the home secretary saying the debate had never reached that stage  amid opposition anger  mr blunkett had to answer an emergency question in parliament on thursday  he said he had taken steps to ensure the incident was not repeated  shadow home secretary david davis welcomed his  gracious apology  and the review itself  but he argued the minister should have volunteered a formal statement instead of having to be  dragged  to face mps  in its report  the law commission said it had found wide support among criminal justice professionals for an end to the mandatory life sentence for murder  the panel suggested different kinds of murders could be  graded  to recognise the seriousness of the offence  but the home office said mandatory life sentences would not be abolished and argued courts already had flexibility  the commission  an independent body including two judges  a senior barrister and sentencing experts  had been asked to consider reforms to the defence of provocation in murder cases  but it said its proposals were unlikely to work without a far wider review of the law  results of a consultation exercise showed 64 respondents out of 146   among them 21 judges   believed a mandatory life sentence for every murder was  indefensible and should cease   a key question was whether one category should continue to cover all types of murder from mercy killings to serial or contract killings  the commission found supp,news article

ten years of  golden  economic performance may come to an end in 2005 with growth slowing markedly  city consultancy deloitte has warned  the uk economy could suffer a backlash from the slowdown in the housing market  triggering a fall in consumer spending and a rise in unemployment  deloitte is forecasting economic growth of 2  this year  below chancellor gordon brown s forecast of 3  to 3 5   it also believes that interest rates will fall to 4  by the end of the year  in its quarterly economic review  deloitte said the uk economy had enjoyed a  golden period  during the past decade with unemployment falling to a near 30 year low and inflation at its lowest since the 1960s  but it warned that this growth had been achieved at the expense of creating major  imbalances  in the economy  deloitte s chief economic advisor roger bootle said   the biggest hit of all is set to come from the housing market which has already embarked on a major slowdown   whereas the main driver of the economy in recent years has been robust household spending growth  this is likely to suffer as the housing market slowdown gathers pace   economic growth is likely to be constrained during the next few years by increased pressure on household budgets and rising taxes  deloitte believes  gordon brown will need to raise about  10bn a year in order to sustain the public finances in the short term  the firm claims  this will result in a marked slowdown in growth in 2005 and 2006 compared to last year  when the economy expanded by 3 25   however  deloitte stressed that the slowdown was unlikely to have any major impact on retail prices while it expected the bank of england to respond quickly to signs of the economy faltering  it expects a series of  aggressive  interest rate cuts over the next two years  with the cost of borrowing falling from its current 4 75  mark to 3 5  by the end of 2006   although 2005 may not be the year when things go completely wrong  it will probably mark the start of a more difficult period for the uk economy   mr bootle,news article

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan has warned that allowing huge us budget deficits to continue could have  severe  consequences  speaking to the house budget committee he urged congress to take action to cut the deficit  such as increasing taxes  while the us economy is growing at a  reasonably good pace  he warned that budget concerns were clouding the economic outlook for the us  pension and healthcare costs posed the greatest risks to the economy  he said  the government program faces severe financial strains in coming decades as the massive baby boom generation retires   i fear that we may have already committed more physical resources to the baby boom generation in its retirement years than our economy has the capacity to deliver  if existing promises need to be changed  those changes should be made sooner rather than later   mr greenspan said  he also warned that unless the nation sees unprecedented rises in productivity  retirement and health programmes would need  significant  changes  he called on congress to cut promised benefits for retirees  as the promised benefits for the soon to retire baby boom generation were much larger than the government could afford  meanwhile any move to narrow the deficit gap by raising taxes could pose a significant risk to the economy by dampening growth and spending  he added  he also urged congress to reinstate lapsed rules that require tax cuts and spending to be offset elsewhere in the budget in an effort to prevent the us heading further into the red  despite the dire warnings  mr greenspan did offer some good news for the short term  as us growth gathers steam and incomes rise that should lead to a narrowing of the deficit  recent increases in defence and homeland security spending were also not expected to continue indefinitely  which should cut some costs  since president george w bush came to office the federal budget has swung from a record surplus to a record deficit of  412bn last year,news article

you can now buy  trusted computers   but can we really trust the pc vendors  asks technology analyst bill thompson  if you have recently bought an ibm thinkvantage computer  a dell optiplex  or one of a whole range of laptops from toshiba  hp compaq or samsung then you may have got more for your money than you realised  inside your shiny new pc is an extra chip called the trusted platform module  tpm  that can be used for a range of hardware based security features  eventually the tpm will be built into the main processor itself  and if the trusted computing group has its way then you will find one in every piece of hardware you own  from mobile phones to tv set top boxes to children s toys  but for the moment it is a separate piece of hardware  providing enhanced security features to programs that know how to use them  and as part of a well designed network system  it can provide a lot more security than we enjoy today  a big advantage of the tpm is that it is hardware based  at the moment most of us rely on software to keep our information safe and secure  it might be password protected user accounts  data encryption programs or a firewall  but it all relies on program code running on an inherently insecure processor  hardware security is less common  even if it is a lot safer  this is partly because it is more expensive to give someone a smartcard than a password  but also because its more work for users  systems administrators and managers  as a result we settle for second best  so when it comes to computer security  trusted systems could be a major step forward  after all  if you have a laptop that will only run programs that have been digitally signed then it will be a lot harder for virus writers to get their malicious code to run  and if all your files are locked automatically then even if you get your computer stolen your personal data will be safeguarded  at the moment support for trusted hardware is not built into major operating systems  instead you have to use special software  like hp s protecttools or wave systems  embassy  this provides file encryption  password management and identity protection  usually for business users who connect to company networks  full support f,news article

a team of us researchers has shown that controlling devices with the brain is a step closer  four people  two of them partly paralysed wheelchair users  successfully moved a computer cursor while wearing a cap with 64 electrodes  previous research has shown that monkeys can control a computer with electrodes implanted into their brain  the new york team reported their findings in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences   the results show that people can learn to use scalp recorded electroencephalogram rhythms to control rapid and accurate movement of a cursor in two directions   said jonathan wolpaw and dennis mcfarlane  the research team  from new york state department of health and state university of new york in albany  said the research was another step towards people controlling wheelchairs or other electronic devices by thought  the four people faced a large video screen wearing a special cap which  meant no surgery or implantation was needed  brain activity produces electrical signals that can be read by electrodes  complex algorithms then translate those signals into instructions to direct the computer  such brain activity does not require the use of any nerves of muscles  so people with stroke or spinal cord injuries could use the cap effectively   the impressive non invasive multidimensional control achieved in the present study suggests that a non invasive brain control interface could support clinically useful operation of a robotic arm  a motorised wheelchair or a neuroprosthesis   said the researchers  the four volunteers also showed that they could get better at controlling the cursor the more times they tried  although the two partially paralysed people performed better overall  the researchers said this could be because their brains were more used to adapting or that they were simply more motivated  it is not the first time researchers have had this sort of success in brain control experiments  some teams have used eye motion and other recording techniques  earlier this year  a team at the mit media labs europe demonstrated a wireless cap which read brain waves to control a computer character,news article

a cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet  the elections watchdog has said  fears that big donors can buy political favours have sparked calls for a limit  in a new report  the electoral commission says it is worth debating a £10 000 cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it  it also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning  there were almost £68m in reported donations to political parties in 2001  2002 and 2003  with nearly £12m of them from individual gifts worth more than £1m  the rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions  the commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash   something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work   while we are not in principle opposed to the introduction of a donation cap  we do not believe that such a major departure from the existing system now would be sensible   says its report  if there was to be a cap  it should be £10 000   a small enough amount to make a difference but which would have banned £56m in donations between 2001 and 2003  even without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more small scale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under £200  it also suggests increasing state funding for parties to £3m so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the house of commons  european parliament  scottish parliament  welsh assembly or northern ireland assembly  and it suggests new ways of boosting election campaigning  seen as a way of improving voter turnout  all local election candidates should be entitled to a free mailshot for campaign leaflets  says the watchdog  and there should be a shift in the amount of money allowed to be spent at elections from a national level to a local level to help politicians engage better with voters  the report suggests doubling the money which can be spent by candidates  while cutting national spending limits from £20m to £15m  the commissi,news article

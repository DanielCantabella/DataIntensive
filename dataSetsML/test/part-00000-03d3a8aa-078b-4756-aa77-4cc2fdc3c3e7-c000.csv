doctor s address dear doctor  this letter is an introduction to my patient  a  who you will be seeing in the near future  he is a pleasant gentleman with a history of wilson s disease  it has been treated with penicillamine  he was diagnosed with this at age 14  he was on his way to south carolina for a trip when he developed shortness of breath  palpitations  and chest discomfort  he went to the closest hospital that they were near in randolph  north carolina and he was found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid rate  he was admitted there and observed  he converted to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously and so he required no further interventions  he was started on lopressor  which he has tolerated well  an echocardiogram was performed  which revealed mild to moderate left atrial enlargement  normal ejection fraction  no other significant valvular abnormality  he reported to physicians there that he had cirrhosis related to his wilson s disease  therefore hepatologist was consulted  there was a recommendation to avoid coumadin secondary to his questionable significant liver disease  therefore he was placed on aspirin 325 mg once a day  in discussion with mr  a and review of his chart that i have available  it is unclear as to the status of his liver disease  however  he has never had a liver biopsy  so his diagnosis of cirrhosis that they were concerned about in north carolina is in doubt  his lfts have remained normal and his copper level has been undetectable on his current dose of penicillamine  i would appreciate your input into the long term management of his anticoagulation and also any recommendations you would have about rhythm control  he is in normal sinus rhythm as of my evaluation of him on 06 12 2008  he is tolerating his metoprolol and aspirin without any difficulty  i guess the big question remains is what level of risk that is entailed by placing him on coumadin therapy due to his potentially paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and evidence of left atrial enlargement that would place him in increased risk of recurrent episodes  i appreciate your input regarding this friendly gentleman  his current medicines include penicillamine 250 mg p o  four times a day  metoprolol 12 5 mg twice a day  and aspirin 325 mg a day  if you have any questions regarding his car,medical transcript

that s what i call a tough game  it was very physical and fair play to the italians they made us work very hard for our victory  their organisation was very  very good and they proved again that they are getting better and better as the years go by  it is by far the strongest italian team that we have faced  we knew all along that we would be a huge threat particularly the first game in the championship  it was not like the days gone by when you could get scores on the board early  we had to work our socks off and try and build our scores gradually  it was really hard work out there and the players have plenty of bumps and bruises to prove it  i m not too bad  but there are one or two others who will be feeling it a bit on monday morning  in the backs  we were not frustrated at such  but the new rucking laws were a little bit problematical  the different interpretations between the referee and the players was a little difficult  but we managed to get the ball in our hands and i got a try near the end of the first half  it s always good to score  it was great work by brian and i always knew i had scored even though it went upstairs to the video referee  eddie  o sullivan  was very calm at half time even though we were only 8 6 ahead  he spelled out what we needed to do and advocated getting the ball out of our own territory  that new ruck law made it a bit more difficult to get out of our own half  we were penalised a lot at the breakdown  and if they had kicked all their chances at goal we would have been behind at the break  so really we went back to playing a territory game and simplifying things and having more patience on the ball  every one was a little down after the game following the injuries to brian and gordon  as yet we do not know the full extent of the injuries  but it does not that good  now we have to focus on scotland and only six days to recover  it s a big ask after such a bruising encounter  i was very impressed the way the scots played against the french on saturday  it could so easily have gone their way but for a couple of decisions  we will be under no illusions it is going to be tough for us  in the meantime  when in rome,news article

the lack of public outrage about the war on terror is a powerful indictment of the failure of human rights groups  amnesty international s chief has said  in a lecture at the london school of economics  irene khan said human rights had been flouted in the name of security since 11 september  2001  she said the human rights movement had to use simpler language both to prevent scepticism and spread a moral message  and it had to fight poverty  not just focus on political rights for elites  ms khan highlighted detentions without trial  including those at the us camp at guantanamo bay in cuba  and the abuse of prisoners as evidence of increasing human rights problems   what s a new challenge is the way in which this age old debate on security and human rights has been translated into the language of war   she said   by using the language of war  human rights are being sidelined because we know human rights do not apply in times of war   ms khan said such breaches were infectious and were now seen in almost very major country in the world   the human rights movement faces a crisis of faith in the value of human rights   she said  that was accompanied by a crisis of governance  where the united nations system did not seem able to hold countries to account  the amnesty secretary general said a growing gap between the perceived influence of human rights group and what they could actually achieve was fuelling scepticism   public passivity on the war against terror is the single most powerful indictment on the failures of human rights groups   she said  ms khan said the movement had failed to mobilise public outrage about what was happening to the human rights system  there needed to be a drive to use simpler language  talking about the basic morality of the issues rather than the complexity of legal processes  such efforts could make the issues more relevant to people across the world  she said  the human rights groups also had to recognise there were new groups which had to be tackled in new ways as power dripped away from state governments  al qaeda  for example  was not going to be impressed by a traditional amnesty letter writing campaign  more also needed to be done to develop a human rights framework for international business corporations  amnesty international members vote,news article

divorced parents seeking access to their children are often disadvantaged by the legal system  mps have said  the constitutional affairs select committee said parents with custody could exploit delays in the system to stop former partners gaining access  courts should be used as a last resort  but where they are  their orders should be enforced more rigorously  mps said  but they rejected the claim made by some campaign groups that there should be a legal presumption of equal access  currently the presumption is that the interests of the child are paramount   an arbitrary  template  imposed on all families  whatever the needs of the child  would relegate the welfare of individual children to a secondary position   the mps said  they said the law should be changed to require family courts specifically to take account of the importance of sustaining the relationship between the child and the non resident parent in contested cases  this would  reassert the rights of non resident parents to contact with their children  as well as the rights of children to contact with both their parents  while maintaining sufficient flexibility to cope with issues of safety   they said  delays in court hearings and the inability to effectively enforce court orders allowed  a new  status quo  arrangement for the children to become established by default   they said   although the courts rigorously avoid conscious bias  there are considerable grounds for accepting that non resident parents are frequently disadvantaged by the system as it is administered at present   given the strong animosity between the parties which is common in contested family cases  we find it hard to believe that tactical delay is not sometimes used to the advantage of resident parents   committee chairman alan beith said the five month inquiry had been a  complex and emotive  one   at the moment  far too many contact and residency cases are being dealt with by the courts when they could be better resolved through professional mediation and negotiation   he said   this situation has to change  the court system should only be used as a last resort  where mediation and negotiation have completely broken down or where issues of abuse or domestic violence need to be dealt with   this will help to reduce delays and improve the,news article

the misanthrope or le misanthrope ou l’atrabilaire amoureux is a comedy of manners in five acts and in verse it is one of the best of molière s plays — and one of the greatest of all comedies — spotlighting the absurdities of social and literary pretension  focusing on a man who is quick to criticize the faults of others  yet remains blind to his own this play satirizes the hypocrisies of french aristocratic society  but it also engages a more serious tone when pointing out the flaws  which all humans possess  the play differs from other farces at the time by employing dynamic characters like alceste and célimène as opposed to the traditionally flat characters used by most satirists to criticize problems in society  it also differs from most of molière s other works by focusing more on character development and nuances than on plot progression  the play  though not a commercial success in its time  survives as molière s best known work today  much of its universal appeal is due to common undercurrents of misanthropy across cultural borders,book description

preoperative diagnoses   1  congenital chylous ascites and chylothorax  2  rule out infradiaphragmatic lymphatic leak  postoperative diagnoses    diffuse intestinal and mesenteric lymphangiectasia  anesthesia    general  indication   the patient is an unfortunate 6 month old baby boy  who has been hospitalized most of his life with recurrent chylothoraces and chylous ascites  the patient has been treated somewhat successfully with tpn and voluntary restriction of enteral nutrition  but he had repeated chylothoraces  last week  dr  x took the patient to the operating room in hopes that with thoracotomy  a thoracic duct leak could be found  which would be successfully closed surgically  however at the time of his thoracotomy exploration what was discovered was a large amount of transdiaphragmatic transition of chylous ascites coming from the abdomen  dr  x opened the diaphragm and could literally see a fountain of chylous fluid exiting through the diaphragmatic hole  this was closed  and we decided that perhaps an abdominal exploration as a last stage effort would allow us to find an area of lymphatic leak that could potentially help the patient from this dismal prognostic disease  we met with his parents and talked to them about this  and he is here today for that attempt  operative findings   the patient s abdomen was relatively soft  minimally distended  exploration through supraumbilical transverse incision immediately revealed a large amount of chylous ascites upon entering into the peritoneal cavity  what we found which explains the chronic chylous ascites and chylothorax was a diffuse lymphangiectatic picture involving the small bowel mesentery approximately two thirds to three quarters of the distal small bowel including all of the ileum  the cecum  and the portion of the ascending colon  it appeared that any attempt to resect this area would have been met with failure because of the extensive lymphatic dilatation all the way down towards the root of the supramesenteric artery  there was about one quarter to one third of the jejunum that did not appear to be grossly involved  but i did not think that resection of three quarters of the patient s small bowel would be viable surgical option  instead  we opted to close his abdomen and refer for potential small intestine,medical transcript

from the internationally bestselling author of no god but god comes a fascinating  provocative  and meticulously researched biography that challenges long held assumptions about the man we know as jesus of nazareth  two thousand years ago  an itinerant jewish preacher and miracle worker walked across the galilee  gathering followers to establish what he called the “kingdom of god ” the revolutionary movement he launched was so threatening to the established order that he was captured  tortured  and executed as a state criminal  within decades after his shameful death  his followers would call him god  sifting through centuries of mythmaking  reza aslan sheds new light on one of history’s most influential and enigmatic characters by examining jesus through the lens of the tumultuous era in which he lived  first century palestine  an age awash in apocalyptic fervor  scores of jewish prophets  preachers  and would be messiahs wandered through the holy land  bearing messages from god  this was the age of zealotry—a fervent nationalism that made resistance to the roman occupation a sacred duty incumbent on all jews  and few figures better exemplified this principle than the charismatic galilean who defied both the imperial authorities and their allies in the jewish religious hierarchy  balancing the jesus of the gospels against the historical sources  aslan describes a man full of conviction and passion  yet rife with contradiction  a man of peace who exhorted his followers to arm themselves with swords  an exorcist and faith healer who urged his disciples to keep his identity a secret  and ultimately the seditious “king of the jews” whose promise of liberation from rome went unfulfilled in his brief lifetime  aslan explores the reasons why the early christian church preferred to promulgate an image of jesus as a peaceful spiritual teacher rather than a politically conscious revolutionary  and he grapples with the riddle of how jesus understood himself  the mystery that is at the heart of all subsequent claims about his divinity  zealot yields a fresh perspective on one of the greatest stories ever told even as it affirms the radical and transformative nature of jesus of nazareth’s life and mission  the result is a thought provoking  elegantly written biography with the pulse,book description

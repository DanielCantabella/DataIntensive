the worst kept secret in scottish football was revealed on thursday when walter smith was named as the new national manager  from the moment berti vogts  miserable tenure in charge of scotland ended  the former rangers and everton boss has been the overwhelming favourite for the post  but is smith the man for what must be one of the hardest jobs in football  the 56 year old takes over at a time when the national side is in the doldrums  scotland have not reached a major finals since the world cup in 1998 and reaching germany 2006 looks near impossible  having picked up just two points from the opening three games in the qualifying race  and the fifa rankings see scotland listed at an all time low of 77th  below the likes of estonia  ghana  angola and thailand  scotland are not blessed with quality players with experience at the top level  so smith will have to get the best out of meagre resources  smith s track record make impressive reading and he is widely respected within the game  the man who was alex ferguson s assistant when scotland played at the 1986 world cup won seven league titles with rangers  and his appointment has been widely endorsed by many of the games  top names  including ferguson and graeme souness  who took him to ibrox as his assistant in 1986  characters like souness  ferguson and current ibrox manager alex mcleish all cite smith s experience and his expansive knowledge of the scottish game  much was made of vogts  inability to express himself to the players and media  that will certainly not be the case with smith  the former dundee united and dumbarton full back is from the managerial old school   straight talking and never slow to let players know when he expects better  often with the use of some colourful invective   but it should be remembered vogts came to scotland with an impressive curriculum vitae   a world cup winner as a player and a european championships winner as a manager  smith will inherit the same problems vogts had   a callow squad of players with no exceptional talents  and it remains to be seen if smith will experience the rash of call offs that blighted so much of vogts  preparation work  a fresh start for the scottish national team was imp,news article

dear reader  in february 2013 i gave a speech at the national prayer breakfast  standing a few feet from president obama  i warned my fellow citizens of the dangers facing our country and called for a return to the principles that made america great many americans heard and responded  but our nation’s decline has continued  today the danger is greater than ever before  and i have never shared a more urgent message than i do now  our growing debt and deteriorating morals have driven us far from the founders’ intent  we’ve made very little progress in basic education  obamacare threatens our health  liberty  and financial future  media elitism and political correctness are out of control  worst of all  we seem to have lost our ability to discuss important issues calmly and respectfully regardless of party affiliation or other differences  as a doctor rather than a politician  i care about what works  not whether someone has an  r  or a  d  after his or her name  we have to come together to solve our problems  knowing that the future of my grandchildren is in jeopardy because of reckless spending  godless government  and mean spirited attempts to silence critics left me no choice but to write this book  i have endeavored to propose a road out of our decline  appealing to every american’s decency and common sense  if each of us sits back and expects someone else to take action  it will soon be too late  but with your help  i firmly believe that america may once again be “one nation under god  indivisible  with liberty and justice for all ” sincerely  ben carson,book description

the original blinx was intended to convert many platform game lovers to microsoft s then new xbox console  its sharp graphics and novel gameplay  with the main character able to pause  slow  rewind and fast forward time  were meant to lure many fans to the new machine  but poor design meant the game became a very frustrating affair with players often stranded half way through a level without the required tools to finish  thankfully  the sequel has fixed many of the original faults  this time around you do not play as blinx but instead you are given the chance to create two unique cat characters and two pig characters  the character generator is very detailed and a few minutes of tweaking and adjusting will create a unique personality to unleash on the game  as the game progresses you swap between the two rival factions  pig and feline  assuming the role of your created characters  the thrust of the game sees the two factions competing to recover pieces of a missing time crystal  as in the original  your feline persona can control time  but this time the pigs get to control space  there are a number of puzzles which require control over time to solve while the pigs can create things such as warps  space bubbles and void traps in order to progress  the control over space and time is achieved through a number of vcr style icons and is quite intuitive  annoyingly  the puzzles are a little too obviously flagged up and most gamers will find it more of a chore than a challenge to solve them  the game has also tried to emulate franchises such as jak and daxter and ratchet and clank on ps2 and so there are a number of combat elements  these are a little predictable and tend to drag the general polish of the game down to a more dulled affair  but the game s excellent graphics  easily the best looking platform game around  sound and dollops of humour make it an attractive game for younger platform fans  blinx 2 is out on xbox now,news article

the first minister s statement that it was okay to get drunk  once in a while  has diverted attention from the real issues  it has been claimed  jack law  chief executive of alcohol focus scotland  said jack mcconnell s comment was  ill advised   the media attention had helped to move the focus from scotland s binge drinking problems  mr law said  scotsman journalist hamish macdonell said he believed the bigger picture had been  obscured  by the remark  mr mcconnell was speaking on monday to more than 100 secondary pupils from schools in the highlands about the problems of binge drinking and drink promotions  the one sentence comment was immediately criticised by the scottish national party which accused him of encouraging young people to get drunk  but the scottish executive has insisted mr mcconnell was speaking about adults and his comments were  a recognition that people will get drunk   mr macdonell  political editor of the scotsman  said   i think we have to say right at the outset that this was a very stupid and ill advised remark by the first minister   if you come out with something like this  saying that by all means get drunk  then you will be pilloried for it   however  he added that  perhaps mr mcconnell could feel rightly aggrieved about the coverage   mr macdonell said   i think the problem here is that he did say a lot more things about binge drinking and under age drinking   but that whole side of things has been lost in the furore over one sentence  i understand why  but i think there is a much bigger message here that has been obscured   mr law  from voluntary body alcohol focus scotland  believed damage had been done to scotland s fight against binge drinking  he said he accepted that young people drank and they did have problems with drink  mr law added   i think the remark was ill advised   but these remarks are blown out of all proportion and they so easily misrepresent what we are trying to do in scotland   we don t want to preach to young people  but we need to acknowledge that they do drink problematically   this diverts us from the real issues which are about promoting responsibility and reducing harm and indeed tackling our drinking culture which is a culture,news article

german business confidence fell in february knocking hopes of a speedy recovery in europe s largest economy  munich based research institute ifo said that its confidence index fell to 95 5 in february from 97 5 in january  its first decline in three months  the study found that the outlook in both the manufacturing and retail sectors had worsened  observers had been hoping that a more confident business sector would signal that economic activity was picking up   we re surprised that the ifo index has taken such a knock   said dz bank economist bernd weidensteiner   the main reason is probably that the domestic economy is still weak  particularly in the retail trade   economy and labour minister wolfgang clement called the dip in february s ifo confidence figure  a very mild decline   he said that despite the retreat  the index remained at a relatively high level and that he expected  a modest economic upswing  to continue  germany s economy grew 1 6  last year after shrinking in 2003  however  the economy contracted by 0 2  during the last three months of 2004  mainly due to the reluctance of consumers to spend  latest indications are that growth is still proving elusive and ifo president hans werner sinn said any improvement in german domestic demand was sluggish  exports had kept things going during the first half of 2004  but demand for exports was then hit as the value of the euro hit record levels making german products less competitive overseas  on top of that  the unemployment rate has been stuck at close to 10  and manufacturing firms  including daimlerchrysler  siemens and volkswagen  have been negotiating with unions over cost cutting measures  analysts said that the ifo figures and germany s continuing problems may delay an interest rate rise by the european central bank  eurozone interest rates are at 2   but comments from senior officials have recently focused on the threat of inflation  prompting fears that interest rates may rise,news article

male life expectancy is much higher than originally estimated  leading pension researchers have said  the pensions policy institute  ppi  said life expectancy for unskilled and professional men has been understated  life expectancy at birth is 71 years for a manual worker and 79 years for a professional   a gap of eight years  but if measured at age 65 instead  the ppi said  a manual worker will live to 81 years and a professional worker to 86 years   a gap of just five years  the ppi s estimate is higher because it excludes people who have died before they reach 65 years of age and also takes into account ongoing improvements in life expectancy  the government has ruled out raising the state pension age  because it says it would penalise lower skilled workers who generally have lower life expectancies  chris curry  ppi research director  said its calculations suggested there could be more pressure on state pension spending than originally envisaged   even people in social class v  unskilled manual workers  who are widely likely to have the lowest life expectancy can still expect to live 16 years after state pension age   he said  researchers have not updated life expectancy projections for women  who on average live longer than men,news article

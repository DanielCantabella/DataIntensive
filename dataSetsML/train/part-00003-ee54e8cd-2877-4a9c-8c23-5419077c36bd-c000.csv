ministers are telling councils to find more sites for travellers  amid continuing rows concerning a string of unauthorised encampments  councils are also to be given stronger powers to move on illegal settlements by gypsy communities on rural land  more money is to be given to councils to develop official caravan parks  said housing minister yvette cooper  in november  mps urged ministers to make councils create sites because 3 500 travellers have no place to stop  ms cooper said an annual scheme to refurbish existing traveller sites would now be extended to consider council bids for new stopping places  that scheme has paid out £25m in four years  with £8m available for 2005   there are two major problems in the planning system at the moment concerning gypsy and traveller sites   said ms cooper   firstly  local authorities are not identifying enough appropriate locations either for private or public sites  and secondly  they do not have enough powers to deal swiftly with development on inappropriate sites   the result is that there are too many developments on inappropriate sites  causing tensions and difficulties for both the neighbouring communities and the gypsies and travellers   that is why we are consulting on a new obligation on local authorities to identify more appropriate sites  as well as new powers to take immediate action if the development is in the wrong place and cannot be tolerated in even the short term because of risk to local amenity and the environment   under the new regulations  expected to be in force in the spring  officials will be able to serve  temporary stop notices  aimed at preventing works on a site before a council has had chance to obtain a full legal ban  many mps with rural constituencies  particularly in eastern england  have been pressing the government to create stronger enforcement powers  saying villagers are suffering because of the legal delays in removing illegal encampments  andrew ryder  of the traveller law reform coalition  said   we welcome talk about an obligation on councils to identify land for gypsies and travellers  so long as it is a real obligation as opposed to a recommendation which could be and was easily ignored   new accommodation proposals for travellers need to be backed up with decent funding and interventio,news article

a rise has been recorded in the number of students from south of the border applying to universities in scotland  however  lifelong learning minister jim wallace said that this would not result in scottish students missing out  applications from england and wales rose by 17  between january 2005 and the previous year  up 23 600 to 27 700  fears had been expressed that a flood of  fee refugees  would try to avoid top up fees of up to £3 000 a year being introduced in england  in june last year  mr wallace announced proposals to increase tuition fees for english students studying in scotland by £2 000 in an attempt to prevent a cross border flood  although no figure has yet been agreed  legislation to introduce the top up fees in england is not due to take effect until autumn 2006 and students who start before then will not have to pay additional fees at all  the figures were made public on thursday by admissions service ucas  universities scotland  which represents university principals  claimed that an increase in applications did not amount to scottish students being squeezed out  director  david caldwell  said some students could be applying in an attempt to avoid the possible increase in annual fees at english universities  but this was not a major factor  he told bbc radio scotland s good morning scotland programme   the reason people are opting for scottish universities is that they are perceived as being of very high quality  they offer very attractive courses and scotland is seen as a very attractive place to study   they know that when they take up their studies in 2006 they will be hit by top up fees if they are going to a university in england and that may be part of the reason why the numbers coming to scotland are so inflated   however  it does not mean that we will see thousands of additional students from england studying here   mr wallace agreed and said the figures had to be looked at in context  he explained that when applications were translated into acceptances  the number was not huge   an additional figure of about 200  also  the picture was further blurred by the fact that applications from wales  where there are no plans for top up fees  have also risen  by 19   mr wallace said   accepting students from all parts of the world does show the high rega,news article

nicholas negroponte  chairman and founder of mit s media labs  says he is developing a laptop pc that will go on sale for less than  100  £53   he told the bbc world service programme go digital he hoped it would become an education tool in developing countries  he said one laptop per child could be   very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family  village and neighbourhood   he said the child could use the laptop like a text book  he described the device as a stripped down laptop  which would run a linux based operating system   we have to get the display down to below  20  to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel   the second trick is to get rid of the fat   if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory   the device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down  mr negroponte said this was a not for profit venture  though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money  in 1995 mr negroponte published the bestselling being digital  now widely seen as predicting the digital age  the concept is based on experiments in the us state of maine  where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on  while the idea was popular amongst the children  it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken  however  mr negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops   we put in 25 laptops three years ago   only one has been broken  the kids cherish these things  it s also a tv a telephone and a games machine  not just a textbook   mr negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious   nokia make 200 million cell phones a year  so for us to claim we re going to make 200 million laptops is a big number  but we re not talking about doing it in three or five years  we re talking about months   he plans to be distributing them by the end of 2006 and is already in discussion with the chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order   in china they s,news article
scientists are working on ways to ensure laptops can stay powered for an entire working day  building batteries from new chemical mixes could boost power significantly  say industry experts  the changes include everything from the way chips for laptops are made  to tricks that reduce the power consumption of displays  ever since laptops appeared the amount of time they last between recharges has been a frustration for users  a survey carried out in 2000 by forrester research found that the shortness of battery life was the most complained about feature of laptops   the focus back then was more on performance and features   said mike trainor  chief mobile technology evangelist for chip giant intel   for most of the 90s battery life was stuck on two to 2 5 hours   but now  he said  laptops can last much longer  it was not just a case of improving battery life by squeezing more out of the lithium ion power packs  he explained  other changes are needed to get to the holy grail of a laptop running for about eight hours before needing a recharge   lithium ion is never going to get there by itself   he said   the industry has done a great job of wringing all possible energy storage out of that technology that they can   some new battery chemistries promise to cram more power into the same space  said mr trainor  though work still needed to be done to get them successfully from the lab to manufacturing  he was sceptical that fuel cells would develop quick enough to take over from solid batteries even though they have the potential to produce several times more energy than lithium ion power packs   in fuel cells you need to have pumps and separators and evaporation chambers   he said   it s a mini energy plant that needs to be shrunk and shrunk and shrunk   intel has been working with component makers to test energy consumption on all the parts inside a laptop and find ways to make them less power hungry  this work has led to the creation of the mobile pc extended battery life  ebl  working group that shares information about building notebooks that are more parsimonious with power  some of the improvements in power use come simply because components on chips are shrinking  said mr trainor  intel has also changed the way it creates transistors on silicon to reduce the power they n,news article

when you are gunning for glory and ultimate success keeping the gunpowder dry is essential  ireland coach eddie o sullivan appears to have done that quite successfully in the run up to this season s six nations championship  he decreed after the 2003 world cup that players should have a decent conditioning period during the year  that became a reality at the end of last summer with a 10 week period at the start of the this season  it may have annoyed his scottish  and in particularly welsh  cousins who huffed and puffed at the disrespect apparently shown to the celtic league  we will say nothing of mike ruddock   poaching   eight of the dragons side that faced leinster on sunday  but  like o sullivan  he was well within his rights  particularly when you are talking about the national side and pride that goes along with it  the irfu has thrown their weight behind o sullivan  who must be glad that in the main  there is centrally controlled contracts  bar keith gleeson who is just returning from a broken leg  everyone of o sullivan s squad is fit  fresh and standing at the oche ready to launch this season s campaign  but i doubt whether o sullivan is going to gloat about the handling of his players  he is not that sort of person  however  he may look at the overworked and injury hit england  wales and france squads whose players have been overworked  and then pat himself on the back for his foresight  but there is still the question of turning up and transferring that freshness into positive results when the referee signals the start of the game  already ireland are being earmarked as hot favourites in many quarters to go the whole hog this season  a first grand slam since karl mullen s led the team to a clean sweep in 1948  with england and france visiting lansdowne road for the last time before the old darling is pulled down  everything looks perfectly placed  but in the days of yore that frightened the life out of any irishman  under the burden of great expectations  ireland have crumpled  take the triple crown winning side of 1985 under mick doyle  they were expected to up the ante further for a grand slam  only the second in ireland s history  what happened in 1986  whitewashed  you see  ireland  in any sport  love to be downsized  then they can go out and prove a point,news article

a blind student has developed software that turns colours into musical notes so that he can read weather maps  victor wong  a graduate student from hong kong studying at cornell university in new york state  had to read coloured maps of the upper atmosphere as part of his research  to study  space weather  mr wong needed to explore minute fluctuations in order to create mathematical models  a number of solutions were tried  including having a colleague describe the maps and attempting to print them in braille  mr wong eventually hit upon the idea of translating individual colours into music  and enlisted the help of a computer graphics specialist and another student to do the programming work   the images have three dimensions and i had to find a way of reading them myself   mr wong told the bbc news website   for the sake of my own study   and for the sake of blind scientists generally   i felt it would be good to develop software that could help us to read colour images   he tried a prototype version of the software to explore a photograph of a parrot  in order to have an exact reference to the screen  a pen and tablet device is used  the software then assigns one of 88 piano notes to individually coloured pixels   ranging from blue at the lower end of this scale to red at the upper end  mr wong says the application is still very much in its infancy and is only useful for reading images that have been created digitally   if i took a random picture and scanned it and then used my software to recognise it  it wouldn t work that well   mr wong has been blind from the age of seven and he thinks that having a  colour memory  makes the software more useful than it would be to a scientist who had never had any vision   as the notes increase in pitch i know the colour s getting redder and redder  and in my mind s eye a patch of red appears   the colour to music software has not yet been made available commercially  and mr wong believes that several people would have to work together to make it viable  but he hopes that one day it can be developed to give blind people access to photographs and other images,news article

choking traffic jams in beijing are prompting officials to look at reorganising car parking charges  car ownership has risen fast in recent years  and there are now two and a half million cars on the city s roads  the trouble is that the high status of car ownership is matched by expensive fees at indoor car parks  making motorists reluctant to use them  instead roads are being clogged by drivers circling in search of a cheaper outdoor option   the price differences between indoor and outdoor lots are unreasonable   said wang yan  an official from the beijing municipal commission for development and reform quoted in the state run china daily newspaper  mr wang  who is in charge of collecting car parking fees  said his team would be looking at adjusting parking prices to close the gap  indoor parking bays can cost up to 250  more than outdoor ones  sports fans who drive to matches may also find themselves the target of the commission s road rage  it wants them to use public transport  and is considering jacking up the prices of car parks near sports grounds  mr wang said his review team may scrap the relatively cheap hourly fee near such places and impose a higher flat rate during matches  indoor parking may be costly  but it is not always secure  mr wang s team are also going to look into complaints from residents about poor service received in exchange for compulsory monthly fees of up to 400 yuan   48  £26   the beijing authorities decided two years ago that visiting foreign dignitaries  motorcades should not longer get motorcycle outriders as they blocked the traffic  unclogging beijing s increasingly impassable streets is a major concern for the chinese authorities  who are building dozens of new roads to create a showcase modern city ahead of the 2008 olympic games,news article

male life expectancy is much higher than originally estimated  leading pension researchers have said  the pensions policy institute  ppi  said life expectancy for unskilled and professional men has been understated  life expectancy at birth is 71 years for a manual worker and 79 years for a professional   a gap of eight years  but if measured at age 65 instead  the ppi said  a manual worker will live to 81 years and a professional worker to 86 years   a gap of just five years  the ppi s estimate is higher because it excludes people who have died before they reach 65 years of age and also takes into account ongoing improvements in life expectancy  the government has ruled out raising the state pension age  because it says it would penalise lower skilled workers who generally have lower life expectancies  chris curry  ppi research director  said its calculations suggested there could be more pressure on state pension spending than originally envisaged   even people in social class v  unskilled manual workers  who are widely likely to have the lowest life expectancy can still expect to live 16 years after state pension age   he said  researchers have not updated life expectancy projections for women  who on average live longer than men,news article

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan has warned that allowing huge us budget deficits to continue could have  severe  consequences  speaking to the house budget committee he urged congress to take action to cut the deficit  such as increasing taxes  while the us economy is growing at a  reasonably good pace  he warned that budget concerns were clouding the economic outlook for the us  pension and healthcare costs posed the greatest risks to the economy  he said  the government program faces severe financial strains in coming decades as the massive baby boom generation retires   i fear that we may have already committed more physical resources to the baby boom generation in its retirement years than our economy has the capacity to deliver  if existing promises need to be changed  those changes should be made sooner rather than later   mr greenspan said  he also warned that unless the nation sees unprecedented rises in productivity  retirement and health programmes would need  significant  changes  he called on congress to cut promised benefits for retirees  as the promised benefits for the soon to retire baby boom generation were much larger than the government could afford  meanwhile any move to narrow the deficit gap by raising taxes could pose a significant risk to the economy by dampening growth and spending  he added  he also urged congress to reinstate lapsed rules that require tax cuts and spending to be offset elsewhere in the budget in an effort to prevent the us heading further into the red  despite the dire warnings  mr greenspan did offer some good news for the short term  as us growth gathers steam and incomes rise that should lead to a narrowing of the deficit  recent increases in defence and homeland security spending were also not expected to continue indefinitely  which should cut some costs  since president george w bush came to office the federal budget has swung from a record surplus to a record deficit of  412bn last year,news article

the memory gordon brown says keeps returning to him   the one that he says is burnt into him   is that of a 12 year old girl  whose parents died of aids  and who is hiv positive herself  mr brown seems haunted by her eyes  desolate of all hope  and then he talks of those eyes that do inspire optimism  an extraordinary performance by schoolgirls of kenya s largest slum  advancing with crowded menace  flicking their hips in a manner almost as disturbing  before the finale of a clenched fist salute and shout of  free education   free education for all   mr brown s message generally  that compassion must become action before that hope is squandered  but he is such a pivotal figure in british politics  it is almost impossible not to ask him why he is doing this  his answer  in part  is because of the missionaries that used to come to his father s church  ever since  he says  africa has been important to him  i ve absolutely no doubt whatsoever this is heartfelt  but he also believes it is time for the world to see a new gordon brown  not the dull  reassuring bank manager but a man driven by a moral passion   and it just so happens the labour party feels an awful lot happier ridding the world of debt than ridding the world of dictators  there s also a sense of liberation  if mr blair won t allow him to run the election campaign then he can at least pretend it was all getting tedious and he d much rather be out examining social problems in the raw  it also goes some way to solving one of the overarching problems for all politicians of all parties  scepticism sliding into cynicism about politics itself  if he can help the world s poor just a little  then it shows politics isn t worthless  but is his vision for africa too grand  can poverty in the continent really be halved  brown replies that no one thought the berlin wall would ever come down either  he s still got to overcome   not only the reluctance of other finance ministers in the world   but also the cynicism of experts who wonder whether debt relief will just be squandered by governments that just won t in the end spend wisely,news article

new powers are needed to close disorderly pubs  bars and clubs for up to a week or even permanently  police chiefs have told mps  association of chief police officers president chris fox said the current 24 hour closure power did not have enough impact on bad landlords  mr fox s comments follow the controversy over plans to allow pubs to open around the clock  he rejected critics  calls for the law change to be delayed  instead  the new licensing act could help reduce drunken disorder   but only if it was properly planned  he argued  acpo made its call for stronger closure powers in a paper for the commons home affairs select committee  after the meeting  mr fox said being able to close premises for only 24 hours did not necessarily make an impact   if it s 12 30 on a saturday morning and you close for 24 hours there s not a lot of pain for the premises because they probably wouldn t open on sunday anyway   this is about getting through to the management that they can t run a disorderly house without facing some immediate sanctions   under acpo s proposal  the closure orders would be used only with the agreement of the local licensing authority  the new licensing laws will give police greater powers to close pubs and clubs   but only for 24 hour periods  mr fox said the drinks industry was currently not regulating itself   it s making money at the cost of human misery and the public purse  and the strategic planning process has been less than useless   he said  mr fox said the new laws  due to start being phased in next month  could help if food outlets  public transport and public toilets could cope with late night drinkers   staggering it  closing hours  will be a solution if the infrastructure is there  if the premises are properly managed and people aren t being served rolling drunk and underage and then tossed out into the street   he said   we have the problem from 11pm to 2am in any event  we have to get a grip on the underlying causes of this   acpo wants pubs and clubs which cause extra work for police and hospitals to have to pay towards the costs  home secretary charles clarke is currently looking at the idea of a levy on the drinks industry to pay for the cost of extra policing  the licensing changes have sparked concern among some mps  councils and some senio,news article

what have the european indoor trials told us  well  i think we could be heading to the european championships with half a dozen medal prospects  it was good to see athletes beginning to make steps forward  to see a few new faces and there were lots of personal bests kicking around  the best performance on the track for me was sarah claxton s win in the 60m hurdles  running sub eight seconds twice in a week puts her right up there and if she repeats that in madrid she will be close to picking up a medal  but what was great about sunday s performance was that she was under pressure to produce the goods when it counted  diane allahgreen has been our best hurdler for some time now and i think she was surprised to be beaten by sarah  and knowing that she got the better of diane in a head to head race will give sarah confidence  in the men s race on saturday  allan scott was right in there and there is definitely more to come from him  in fact  the men s 60m hurdles is so strong  i think the selectors will pick three hurdlers to go to madrid  phillips idowu lit up the field events  not only with his hair  but also with his leap of 17 30m  which puts him at the top of the world rankings  i had a chat with him before the competition and he was really looking forward to getting out there  he feels he is in great shape and has some big jumps inside him   but then phillips always has  a lot of the athletes said the runway was not very helpful  so for phillips to jump like that is a good performance  he is such a huge talent but just needs some consistency   and if he does that then the big jumps will get even further  across the board i thought kelly sotherton had a great weekend and continued to show she is developing  she picked up three personal bests in the long jump  high jump and 60m hurdles and you can t ask for more than that  kelly will be up against carolina kluft in the pentathlon at the european championships but she has every chance of a medal on the basis of what we ve seen so far  she has a complicated training regime where different people help her with different disciplines but it seems to be working really well  it wasn t all good news in sheffield  i thought both the 60m races were disappointing in different ways  jason gardener may have won but he wasn t at his b,news article

a group of mps and peers has called for a tightening of regulations controlling betting on sport  the parliamentary group on betting and gaming held a substantial inquiry into betting last year  it followed fears that a massive increase in betting on sport  such as that done using the internet and mobile phones  has led to more cheating  the all party group recommended 15 ways to protect punters and improve the integrity of sports betting  they include a proposal for raising the maximum jail sentence for gambling cheats above the current two years  lord condon  head of the international cricket council s anti corruption unit  who originally made the call for longer prison sentences  said the two year penalty was  derisory    you could get a bigger sentence for failing to pay your hotel bill criminally than you could for corruption in major sports   symbolically  a higher penalty  perhaps as the bill passes through the two houses  might be appropriate   the report recommended the governing bodies of sports have a say in the type of bets offered to punters  and for bookmakers to set up  audit trails    something the new betting exchanges already do   to allow suspicious betting patterns to be traced  lord faulkner of worcester  who chaired the inquiry  said   whilst we accept that the greater part of sports betting is neither corrupt nor unfair to punters  the evidence convinces us that the growth of betting exchanges   because of the facility they provide to bet against a result   has increased the potential for corruption   it is important that the government works with sporting administrators to review the difficulties faced by governing bodies in convicting the guilty and penalising them appropriately   the panel s aim was to try to define what constitutes cheating  assess how much might be going on and suggest what the government might do to put it right  as well as the growth of internet and mobile phone betting  there has been the creation of betting exchanges which allow punters to fix odds between themselves  betting exchanges allow punters to back  to win  but also lay  to lose  a horse  this means they can control their odds at winning by placing their money both ways,news article

the us economy added 337 000 jobs in october   a seven month high and far more than wall street expectations  in a welcome economic boost for newly re elected president george w bush  the labor department figures come after a slow summer of weak jobs gains  jobs were created in every sector of the us economy except manufacturing  while the separate unemployment rate went up to 5 5  from 5 4  in september  this was because more people were now actively seeking work  the 337 000 new jobs added to us payrolls in october was twice the 169 000 figure that wall street economists had forecast  in addition  the labor department revised up the number of jobs created in the two previous months   to 139 000 in september instead of 96 000  and to 198 000 in august instead of 128 000  the better than expected jobs data had an immediate upward effect on stocks in new york  with the main dow jones index gaining 45 4 points to 10 360 by late morning trading   it looks like the job situation is improving and that this will support consumer spending going into the holidays  and offset some of the drag caused by high oil prices this year   said economist gary thayer of ag edwards   sons  other analysts said the upbeat jobs data made it more likely that the us federal reserve would increase interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 2  when it meets next week   it should empower the fed to clearly do something   said robert macintosh  chief economist with eaton vance management in boston  kathleen utgoff  commissioner of the bureau of labor  said many of the 71 000 new construction jobs added in october were involved in rebuilding and clean up work in florida  and neighbouring deep south states  following four hurricanes in august and september  the dollar rose temporarily on the job creation news before falling back to a new record low against the euro  as investors returned their attention to other economic factors  such as the us s record trade deficit  there is also speculation that president bush will deliberately try to keep the dollar low in order to assist a growth in exports,news article

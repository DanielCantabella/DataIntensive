god games  in which players must control virtual people and societies could be educational  says research  a us researcher has suggested that games such as the sims could be a good way to teach languages  ravi purushotma believes that the world of the sims can do a better job of teaching vocabulary and grammar than traditional methods  the inherent fun of game playing could help to make learning languages much less of a chore  said mr purushotma  there must be few parents or teachers that do not worry that the lure of a video game on a computer or console is hard to resist by children that really should be doing their homework  but instead of fearing computer games  ravi purushotma believes that educationalists  particularly language teachers should embrace games   one goal would be to break what i believe to be the false assumption that learning and play are inherently oppositional   he said  he believes that the  phenomenal ability  of games such as the sims and others to capture the interest of adolescent audiences is ripe for exploitation  the hard part of learning any language  said mr purushotma  were the basic parts of learning what different words refer to and how they are used to build up sentences  boring lessons drumming vocabulary into pupils couched in terms they do not understand has made many languages far harder to learn than they should be   the way we often teach foreign languages right now is somewhat akin to learning to ride a bike by formally studying gravity   he said  by contrast  said mr purushotma  learning via something like the sims may mean students do not feel like they are studying at all  this was because the sims does not rely solely on words to get information across to players  instead the actions of its computer controlled people and how they interact with their world often makes clear what is going on  the incidental information about what a sim was doing could reinforce what a player or student was supposed to be learning  said mr purushotma  by contrast many language lessons try to impart information about a tongue with little context  for instance  he said  in a version of the sims adapted to teach german  if a player misunderstood what was meant,news article

michael howard has finally revealed the full scale of his planned tory tax cuts  should he win the next general election  he has earmarked £4 billion that will be used to reduce taxes   although he still will not say which or how  this was the pre election message many in his party have been pressing for and voters  he believes  will warm to  at its simplest  it is saying   vote tory and you can have it both ways   not only would his government stick to labour spending plans on core public services  including health and education  it would increase spending on defence  police and pensions  and even after that was done  it would still have enough left over for a tax cut equivalent to about a penny off the basic rate of income tax  all the money would come from its £35 billion efficiency savings which would see the axe taken to bureaucracy  waste and the civil service  of that  £23 billion would go on spending plans  with £8 billion to fill the black hole left  they claim  by gordon brown  and the rest going in tax cuts  neither mr howard nor mr letwin would say exactly how they would use that cash  although a cut in the basic rate seems unlikely  ideas already floated include raising tax thresholds and abolishing or reducing inheritance tax  although some in the tory party are urging mr howard to announce something more eye catching before the election  as the tory leader declared  the aim of the exercise is to open up a real economic policy divide between labour and the tories   at this election  people will have a clear choice between mr blair who will waste more and tax more and the conservative party which will give value for money and tax less   he said  it is a move back towards an almost traditional tory message which previously suggested labour was the party of tax rises and the conservatives the party of tax cuts  the extension of that  however  was that labour was also seen as the party of big spending on the public services while the tories were the cutters  and that is where one of the problems lies for mr howard   can he persuade sceptical voters that they really can have it both ways with bigger spending on public services and lower taxes  he insists he will not promise any,news article

the international rugby board may have to step in to stop frustrated coaches and players from publicly haranguing referees when things go belly up  it may have to go the whole way and have nfl style video cameras all over the field  or slap the vociferous perpetrators over the knuckles  what the irb does not want is a football scenario where the verbal slanging matches often overshadow the game itself  sunday s explosive six nations clash at lansdowne road was a good example as ireland took another step towards their first grand slam since 1948  the game was as exciting as it comes  with a much improved england side enraged at a few decisions that did not go their way  one can understand that frustration  there was no doubt that ireland had the rub of the green in their 19 13 victory  but the reaction from the england camp may not have endeared them to the sport s  blazers   referee jonathan kaplan was not perfect by any means and two decisions in particular made him the villain of the piece  i doubt whether kaplan would have been too pleased at the comments made  after all  he has no public recourse to criticism  it was the same for simon mcdowell  the touch judge who was heavily criticised by scotland coach matt williams after their defeat against france  as far as england were concerned  there were queries over mark cueto s first half effort when he went over in the corner from a charlie hodgson kick  england coach andy robinson referred to a similar case at ravenhill in january when ulster were playing gloucester in the heineken cup  on that occasion  david humphreys kicked to tommy bowe  who touched down in the corner only for the try to be wiped out  but you cannot have cameras at every conceivable angle to pick up such anomalies  perhaps robinson was right to say the referee should have gone upstairs when josh lewsey was driven over the irish line near the end  lewsey claims he touched it down and was in full control  however  one has to credit ireland flanker johnny o connor for cleverly scooping the ball away and blocking any evidence of a touchdown  but in rugby  everything tends to even out over the 80 minutes  the referee also missed england s danny grewcock taking out ronan,news article

a blind student has developed software that turns colours into musical notes so that he can read weather maps  victor wong  a graduate student from hong kong studying at cornell university in new york state  had to read coloured maps of the upper atmosphere as part of his research  to study  space weather  mr wong needed to explore minute fluctuations in order to create mathematical models  a number of solutions were tried  including having a colleague describe the maps and attempting to print them in braille  mr wong eventually hit upon the idea of translating individual colours into music  and enlisted the help of a computer graphics specialist and another student to do the programming work   the images have three dimensions and i had to find a way of reading them myself   mr wong told the bbc news website   for the sake of my own study   and for the sake of blind scientists generally   i felt it would be good to develop software that could help us to read colour images   he tried a prototype version of the software to explore a photograph of a parrot  in order to have an exact reference to the screen  a pen and tablet device is used  the software then assigns one of 88 piano notes to individually coloured pixels   ranging from blue at the lower end of this scale to red at the upper end  mr wong says the application is still very much in its infancy and is only useful for reading images that have been created digitally   if i took a random picture and scanned it and then used my software to recognise it  it wouldn t work that well   mr wong has been blind from the age of seven and he thinks that having a  colour memory  makes the software more useful than it would be to a scientist who had never had any vision   as the notes increase in pitch i know the colour s getting redder and redder  and in my mind s eye a patch of red appears   the colour to music software has not yet been made available commercially  and mr wong believes that several people would have to work together to make it viable  but he hopes that one day it can be developed to give blind people access to photographs and other images,news article

the war of words between microsoft and the open source movement heated up this week as linux founder linus torvalds led an attack on software patents  in a panel discussion at a linux summit in california mr torvalds said software patents were a problem for the open source movement  mitchell kapor  chairman of the mozilla foundation  warned that microsoft could use patent lawsuits in the future  linux is a freely available alternative to microsoft s windows  it relies on a community of programmers for its development and is based on open source principles  which allow others to use and modify it without having to pay licence fees  the attack on software patents comes at a time when ibm has made 500 of its patents freely available  other companies are expected to follow suit  there are between 150 000 and 300 000 registered software patents in the us and open source developers argue that many should never have been granted  this is a view corroborated by the uk patent office   some of the patents have dubious validity and are being wielded by some big companies to force smaller companies to buy licenses in the knowledge that they can t afford to take them to court   said dr jeremy philpott of the uk patent office  some panel members are worried that microsoft would issue a series of patent lawsuits in the future   if totally pushed to the wall   because their business model no longer holds up in an era in which open source is an economically superior way to produce software   of course they re going to unleash the wmds   mr kapor is reported as saying  microsoft did not want to comment directly  referring the issue instead to trade body intellect  of which it is a member   as far as intellect is concerned  open source and patents have co existed for many years without problems   said spokeswoman jill sutherland   the industry respects the open source movement and in fact many of the members we represent use the open source system to develop software    we think the important point to make is that companies should be able to choose between patents  copyrights and open source as to the treatment of their intellectual discoveries  and not be forced into using one or the other   she added,news article

for gaming fans  the word goldeneye evokes excited memories not only of the james bond revival flick of 1995  but also the classic shoot em up that accompanied it and left n64 owners glued to their consoles for many an hour  adopting that hallowed title somewhat backfires on this new game  for it fails to deliver on the promise of its name and struggles to generate the original s massive sense of fun  this however is not a sequel  nor does it relate to the goldeneye film  you are the eponymous renegade spy  an agent who deserts to the bond world s extensive ranks of criminal masterminds  after being deemed too brutal for mi6  your new commander in chief is the portly auric goldfinger  last seen in 1964  but happily running around bent on world domination  with a determination to justify its name which is even less convincing than that of tina turner s similarly titled theme song  the game literally gives the player a golden eye following an injury  which enables a degree of x ray vision  rogue agent signals its intentions by featuring james bond initially and proceeding to kill him off within moments  squashed by a plummeting helicopter  the notion is of course to add a novel dark edge to a 007 game  but the premise simply does not get the juices flowing like it needs to  recent bond games like nightfire and everything or nothing were very competent and did a fine job of capturing the sense of flair  invention and glamour of the film franchise  this title lacks that aura  and when the bond magic shines through  it feels like a lucky accident  the central problem is that the gameplay just is not good enough  quite aside from the bizarre inability to jump  the even more bizarre glaring graphical bugs and dubious enemy ai  the levels simply are not put together with much style or imagination  admittedly the competition has been tough  even in recent weeks  with the likes of halo 2 and half life 2 triumphing in virtually every department  what the game is good at is enveloping you in noisy  dynamic scenes of violent chaos  as is the trend of late  you are made to feel like you are in the midst of a really messy and fraught encounter  sadly that sense of action is outweighed by the difficult,news article

if you don t know art but know what you like  new search technology could prove a useful gateway to painting  artgarden  developed by bt s research unit  is being tested by the tate as a new way of browsing its online collection of paintings  rather than search by the name of an artist or painting  users are shown a selection of pictures  clicking on their favourite will change the gallery in front of them to a selection of similar works  the technology uses a system dubbed smart serendipity  which is a combination of artificial intelligence and random selection  it  chooses  a selection of pictures  by scoring paintings based on a selection of keywords associated with them  so  for instance a whistler painting of a bridge may have the obvious keywords such as bridge and whistler associated to it but will also widen the search net with terms such as aesthetic movement  19th century and water  a variety of paintings will then be shown to the user  based partly on the keywords and partly on luck   it is much more akin to wandering through the gallery   said jemima rellie  head of the tate s digital programme  for richard tateson  who worked on the artgarden project  the need for a new way to search grew out of personal frustration   i went to an online clothes store to find something to buy my wife for christmas but i didn t have a clue what i wanted   he said  the text based search was restricted to looking either by type of garment or designer  neither of which he found helpful  he ended up doing his present shopping on the high street instead  he thinks the dominance of text based searching is not necessarily appealing to the majority of online shoppers  similarly  with art  browsing is often more important than finding a particular object   you don t arrive at tate britain and tell people what you want to see  one of the skills of showing off the collection is to introduce people to things they wouldn t have asked for   he said  the tate is committed to making its art more accessible and technology such as artgarden can help with that  said ms rellie  she hopes the technology can be incorporated on to the website in the near future  bt research is looking at extending the technology t,news article

other things being equal  the notion of entrepreneurs languishing in jail while their companies are sold off for a song ought to be bad for business  but in the looking glass world of modern russia  the opposite might just be true  a new report  has argued  the study  from the centre for economic policy research  does not praise the rough handling of oil company yukos  but it argues that more rigorous tax policing has benefited all russian firms  even targets of the tax police   an increase in tax enforcement can increase the amount  of dividends and other income  outside shareholders will receive  even accounting for increased levels of taxation   the authors say  the paper s reasoning is complex  and is based on a sophisticated model of the relationship between tax regimes and corporate governance   in particular  the propensity of management to steal from the company  the calculations demonstrated what many russian analysts already knew  that increasing the tax rate increases the amount that managers steal  since undeclared income becomes relatively more valuable  in the west  meanwhile  higher tax rates translate far more smoothly into higher government revenues  on the other hand  increasing the rigour with which taxes are collected encourages companies to become more transparent  forcing them to be able to demonstrate their financial position far more accurately  the net result  the authors say  is that the extra amount companies pay in tax is more than compensated for by greater efficiency and financial soundness  after vladimir putin became president in 2000  he did not raise taxes  but put a lot of effort   too much  critics argue   into enforcement  since then  the russian stock market has more than trebled in value  a rise the authors attribute at least in part to the newly tough approach  the report highlights the case of sibneft  a russian oil company that came close to merging with yukos last year  after mr putin came to power  the company s overall effective tax rate rose from 2 6  to 10 4   and sibneft was the target of a series of aggressive raids by fiscal police  but shareholders benefited hugely  sibneft started to pay dividends    53m in 2000 and almost  1bn in 2001,news article

ministers have insisted they are committed to free personal care for the elderly despite research suggesting the cost of the policy was under estimated  a report by the fraser of allander institute says the decision to push ahead with the flagship policy was based on flawed research  deputy health minister rhona brankin has pledged to study the research  snp holyrood leader nicola sturgeon said the public needed reassurance that the care programme was secure  the rise in costs stems from a series of mistakes in the research used by the  care development group  of scottish executive experts who prepared the original costings  according to findings published in the quarterly economic commentary of strathclyde university s fraser of allander institute   dubious  assumptions about improving health expectancy could drive the cost of the policy up by another £130m by 2022  the report warned  it was carried out by husband and wife economist team jim and margaret cuthbert  but ms brankin told bbc radio scotland   we don t think we got our sums wrong   obviously we will examine the findings of this new report  along with figures from our own research that we have already commissioned   we will look in great detail at any contribution to this  because we need to be sure we can provide free personal care and nursing care for our older people into the future   and we are absolutely committed to doing that   but the scottish national party called on ministers to reassure people that enough funding is in place to support the free personal care policy  ms sturgeon said that while she had no reason to doubt the executive s support for the policy  there were questions which needed to be answered and  if necessary  sums redone  she said   serious concerns have been raised and there are questions which need to be answered by the scottish executive   we need to know that the money is there  not just for this year or next year  but into the future so that older people  and those who are looking forward to older age  can rest assured that their personal care needs will be met,news article

broadcasters should fix a date for a pre election televised debate between the three main political leaders  according to the hansard society  it would then be up to tony blair  michael howard and charles kennedy to decide whether to take part  the non partisan charity said  chairman lord holme argued that prime ministers should not have the right of veto on a matter  of public interest    the broadcasters should make the decision to go ahead   he said  lord holme s proposal for a televised debate comes just four months after millions of viewers were able to watch us president george w bush slug it out verbally with his democratic challenger john kerry  he said it was a  democratically dubious proposition  that it was up to the incumbent prime minister to decide whether a similar event takes place here  if mr blair did not want to take part  the broadcasters could go ahead with an empty chair or cancel the event and explain their reasons why  lord holme said   what makes the present situation even less acceptable is that although mr howard and mr kennedy have said they would welcome a debate  no one has heard directly from the prime minister   he said   it has been left to nudges and winks  hints and briefings from his aides and campaign managers to imply that mr blair doesn t want one  but we haven t heard from the prime minister himself   lord holme  who has campaigned for televised debates at previous elections  said broadcasters were  more than willing to cooperate with the arrangements   opinion polls suggested that the idea had the backing of the public who like comparing the personalities and policies of the contenders in their own homes  he said  lord holme argued that as part of their public service obligations  broadcasters  should make the decision to go ahead  as soon as the election is called  an independent third party body such as the hansard society or electoral commission could work out the ground rules so they were fair to participants and informative to the public  he said   it would be up to each party leader to accept or refuse   said lord holme   if the prime minister s reported position is true and he does want to take part  he would then be obliged to say why pub,news article

the liberal democrats have unveiled plans to build 100 000 new  affordable  homes on publicly owned land  the party s scheme would allow people to buy a share in a home through a mutual home ownership trust  as a way of getting onto the housing ladder  the lib dems would also encourage the conversion of existing buildings in an effort to protect greenfield sites  labour has already announced plans to help first time buyers and the tories would extend right to buy schemes  all the major parties are focusing on the issue in the run up to the election after a survey suggested first time buyers could not afford a home in 92  of uk towns  the lib dems say their  mutual homes  would let people buy a share of a property  usually worth about 5  of the building costs  party leader charles kennedy said the homes would be affordable because they would be built on surplus public sector land  donated by central or local government  people would also only have to pay for the cost of the building and not the land  he added  they would spend about 30  of their monthly salary on rent and buying extra shares in the property  when they moved house  they would be able to cash in on any rise in property prices by selling their share  it would also allow councils to vary discounts to tenants given the right to buy their council homes so local needs were taken into account  mr kennedy said   mutual homes will offer people the opportunity to build up an equity stake in a home gradually  investing only as much as they can afford   there are also plans to prevent high house prices forcing people out of their local communities  the kind of  golden share  used by the lib dems in south shropshire could be rolled out more widely  under the plan  councils secure deals with developers where they keep a 1  share in a property scheme so properties cannot be sold on the open market  instead  they are sold at  build cost  to people who the local council decides have local needs  the party says its help for first time buyers can be funded at no extra cost to the taxpayer  but the plans involve changing the vat system  which the party says often makes it too expensive to renovate existing buildings  the conservatives claime,news article

charles kennedy has told voters his liberal democrats will offer them an  honest choice  at the next general election  with the other two big parties battling over which will impose the lowest taxes  mr kennedy is going into the looming election pledged to increase taxation  it is a bold policy and certainly ensures there is that choice between the lib dems and the other two  with his party s previous pledge to increase taxes by one penny in the pound to spend on public services already adopted by the government  he has switched tack  now he is promising to levy a  modest  increase of the same amount on earnings over £100 000 a year to allow him to finance a series of pledges  they are to scrap student fees  finance free long term care for the elderly and replace the council tax with a local income tax  that last policy will also see about 3  of the most well off paying more while others  pensioners in particular  will pay less  labour and the tories have attacked his policies as both unworkable and not properly costed  inevitably they insist there is no need to raise taxes to fund improvements in services  the tories claim they can improve services and cut taxes through £35bn efficiency savings  while labour has offered £22bn savings but has yet to map out precise tax proposals  although there is little chance they will propose increases  in many ways the argument between the lib dems and the others over taxation and spending echo the sort of arguments that raged between labour and the tories in the 1980s and early 1990s  but  unlike the old tory labour debate  he believes voters are ready to see  modest  tax increases on the well off in order to fund improvements in services  that is a view partly endorsed by recent polls suggesting people would rather have cash spent on public services than tax cuts  similarly there is a different tone to the lib dem approach to asylum and immigration  with mr kennedy stressing politicians should not  foment an artificial debate  about immigration and attacking michael howard s proposals for quotas  once again  with the two other big parties singing similar songs on immigration  mr kennedy is stressing the different  more liberal approach of his part,news article

gordon brown has failed to tackle the  fundamental unfairness  in the tax system in his ninth budget  charles kennedy has said  how was it right that the poorest 20  of society were still paying more as a proportion of their income than the richest 20   the lib dem leader asked  the new £200 council tax rebate for pensioners did nothing to fix the  unfair tax   he added  the government could not go on  patching up  the system  he added  speaking in the commons after mr brown had delivered what is widely thought to be the last budget before the general election  mr kennedy acknowledged that the uk was one of the most successful economies in the world  but he criticised both the chancellor and the tories for failing to address the  ticking bomb  of council tax revaluation  he said the recent experience of wales indicated seven million households in england would pay significantly more after revaluation  the chancellor s announcement that he was to offer a £200 council tax rebate paid by pensioner households was merely a  sticking plaster  to a much bigger problem  the lib dem plan for a local income tax would benefit the typical household by more than £450 a year  with half of all pensioners paying no local tax and about three million being better off  on pensions  mr kennedy said it was a  scandal  that the system discriminated against women who had missed making national insurance payments when they were having children  he said a residency criteria would end  at a stroke this fundamental iniquity   mr kennedy added his party s priorities of free long term care for the elderly  abolishing top up fees and replacing the council tax would be funded by charging 50  income tax to those earning more than £100 000 per annum  he contrasted his approach with mr brown s pledge in 2001 not to increase income tax  the chancellor went on to put up national insurance contributions after the election   for most individuals  most families  most households  it adds up to exactly the same thing   said mr kennedy   and they wonder why people get cynical about their politicians when they give one impression before an election and do exactly the opposite after that election,news article

this third harry potter film brought a change of director and a dramatic visual shake up that really shines on dvd  gone are the warm  bright colours found in the two earlier films  alfonso cuaron brings in a bleak and cold feel that is simply gorgeous   and looks even better here than in the cinema  it is all part of the progression of harry s story into darker areas  but you ll spend time just marvelling at the beautiful hogwarts landscape  this is the first potter film where you get so lost in the screen adaptation that you forget the book  it is the third year at hogwarts and studies are interrupted  as they always are  by a calamity that only harry  ron and hermione can put right  it sounds corny  but harry is no longer the winsome hero  he is a moody teenager and daniel radcliffe pulls it off very well  emma watson is ever better as hermione  and the young stars are joined by the usual myriad famous actors including gary oldman and emma thompson  the film itself is the reason to buy this dvd  but it is laden with behind the scenes extras  including funny  if shallow  interviews with all the main cast  but what seems like a long list of features can be swiftly whittled down to the few that you are going to watch  younger viewers will go for the games which include a magic you may have missed memory test  and crookshanks chasing off after scabbers  adult viewers will ignore those and go straight to the deleted scenes  you will understand why they were deleted but it is fun to see more footage   and not have to hunt through endless menus to find it  as we did on the first harry potter dvd  the most interesting pieces are an interview with jk rowling in creating the vision and conjuring a scene  a short featurette about the making of the film s big moments,news article

a cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet  the elections watchdog has said  fears that big donors can buy political favours have sparked calls for a limit  in a new report  the electoral commission says it is worth debating a £10 000 cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it  it also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning  there were almost £68m in reported donations to political parties in 2001  2002 and 2003  with nearly £12m of them from individual gifts worth more than £1m  the rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions  the commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash   something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work   while we are not in principle opposed to the introduction of a donation cap  we do not believe that such a major departure from the existing system now would be sensible   says its report  if there was to be a cap  it should be £10 000   a small enough amount to make a difference but which would have banned £56m in donations between 2001 and 2003  even without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more small scale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under £200  it also suggests increasing state funding for parties to £3m so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the house of commons  european parliament  scottish parliament  welsh assembly or northern ireland assembly  and it suggests new ways of boosting election campaigning  seen as a way of improving voter turnout  all local election candidates should be entitled to a free mailshot for campaign leaflets  says the watchdog  and there should be a shift in the amount of money allowed to be spent at elections from a national level to a local level to help politicians engage better with voters  the report suggests doubling the money which can be spent by candidates  while cutting national spending limits from £20m to £15m  the commissi,news article

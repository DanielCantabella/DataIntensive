when stephen covey first released the seven habits of highly effective people  the book became an instant rage because people suddenly got up and took notice that their lives were headed off in the wrong direction  and more than that  they realized that there were so many simple things they could do in order to navigate their life correctly  this book was wonderful education for people  education in how to live life effectively and get closer to the ideal of being a ‘success’ in life but not everyone understands stephen covey’s model fully well  or maybe there are some people who haven’t read it yet  this is definitely true because we still see so much failure all around us  now  i am not saying that by using covey’s model  or anyone else’s model for that matter  you can become a sure shot success  but at least we should have seen many more successes around us already judging by the number of copies the book has sold  so  where is the shortcoming there are two main problems here  and we are talking only about the people who have read the book already  the first problem is that most people are too lazy to implement the ideals of stephen covey in their lives  they consider his masterpiece of a book as a mere coffee table book or a book that you use for light reading when you are traveling and then forget all about it  they do not realize that this book contains life changing information  or  they take the information and do not make the effort to actually utilize it so that it becomes knowledge for them the second problem is that a lot of people have a myopic view of covey’s ideals  these are people who are impressed by the book already  if you ask them what the seven habits are  they can rattle them off end to end  but then they miss the larger picture  they do not understand that covey was trying to tell more than he wrote in words  there are hidden implications in this book  yes  and a lot of people have just failed to see through them that is what we are trying to do  we are trying to show you how covey’s book  or rather  his model  was a complete model in itself  there was nothing amiss about it  if you implement it  there should be no aspect of your life that should go untouched  th,book description

if there is one thing certain to stiffen the spines of labour mps it is the prospect of losing their seats at a general election  and it was largely that fear that led to tony blair and gordon brown being read the riot act during a meeting of the parliamentary labour party  the views expressed by both backbenchers and labour peers over the claimed squabbling between the two men starkly demonstrated the widely held view within the labour party that the two most powerful figures in the government are jeopardising the next election  as one hugely disgruntled backbencher said before the meeting   it is time they realised it s not just my seat they are threatening but if they go on like this they could put the election in doubt   it is a sentiment that is now running throughout the labour benches with mps eager to underline the message to their leaders to stop the squabbling and get on with the job at hand  as paul flynn said   what has deeply upset the party is in this time of all times  when we wanted to come together  we wanted to lead on the global issues  to change politics for the next decade  the whole thing was wrecked by a piece of childishness by the two main people in the party  two people we greatly respect   stephen pound echoed the message  saying   we know that the one thing that could entirely jeopardise what we are trying to achieve  not for the labour party but for this country  is the appearance of division  we remember the 1980s   they backed the suggestion that unless the squabbling stopped  the people briefing on behalf of the two men would be  named and shamed   the dressing down appears to have done the trick  with mr brown joining his alleged rival alan milburn   who the prime minister put in charge of election planning in mr brown s stead   and deputy prime minister john prescott at an election poster launch  but the effect of all this is to have achieved two things  firstly  nobody is attempting to suggest any more that the stories of the rift between the chancellor and the prime minister are fictions created by the media and authors  even mr prescott admitted that  had he still been a backbencher  he would have been giving mr blair and mr brown the same message  s,news article

with impeccable and precisely calculated timing  tory defector robert jackson and his new labour bosses have attempted to overshadow michael howard s latest announcement on taxation and spending  with just about everyone in westminster now working towards a may general election  mr howard is eager to map out some clear and distinctive policies aimed at finally shifting the tories  resolutely depressing poll showings  the big idea is his £35bn savings on waste and bureaucracy which mr howard has pledged to plough back into public services and tax cuts  and it was virtually certain his pledge on tax cuts was meant to be the core message from his interview on the bbc one s breakfast with frost programme  he and his shadow chancellor oliver letwin have been edging towards an announcement on this front for some months now  but without any concrete pledges  but mr howard announced that  of the £35bn he has earmarked from savings  £12bn will be used to plug labour s claimed financial black hole with any left over going to tax cuts in mr letwin s first budget  he would not be precise  but there are already suggestions he is set to announce lifting the threshold on income tax and reforming or abolishing inheritance tax  but he did  for the first time  say there would be such tax cuts   at this election  people will have a clear choice between mr blair who will waste more and tax more and the conservative party which will give value for money and tax less   it is the tories  attempt to open that famed  clear blue water  between them and the labour party and return to a traditional tory agenda that will both reassure the middle england voters who have abandoned him and appeal to core conservative voters  so it is a pretty safe bet to assume that  when robert jackson finally decided to jump ship and swim over to the labour benches  his new masters decided to time the announcement for the greatest possible impact  mr howard  however  was dismissive   these things happen from time to time  there are disagreements between robert jackson and me   the election is not going to be decided on what robert jackson did   he added  and that is certainly true  the election will be decided on  the economy stupid,news article

immigration and asylum have normally been issues politicians from the big parties have tiptoed around at election time  but no longer  both labour and the tories have signalled their intention of making them central to their election campaigns  they have been struck by the level of concern amongst voters about the issues  with internal surveys showing they have the potential to swing large numbers of votes  that was also true at the last general election and the issue did briefly become a campaigning issue  but it sparked the probably predictable furore with claims politicians were either stoking up xenophobia or  alternatively  running scared of addressing the problem  but this time around it looks set to be one of the core battlegrounds with both the big parties competing to set out tough policies  the tories are already committed to imposing annual limits on immigration  with a quota for asylum seekers and with applications processed outside the uk  labour has already branded the proposal unworkable but party strategists have seen the tories seizing a poll advantage over the issue  now home secretary charles clarke has come up with alternative proposals for a points system to ensure only immigrants who can benefit the economy will be granted entry  and to kick out more failed asylum seekers  that has been attacked by the tories as too little  too late and for failing to tackle the key issue of the numbers entering the uk  the liberal democrats have not been drawn too deeply into the argument but have called for a europe wide policy on immigration  but  while all the parties appear to agree the time has come to properly debate and address the issue  there are already signs they will run into precisely the same problems as before  former union leader sir bill morris has already accused both the big parties of engaging in a  bidding war about who can be nastiest to asylum seekers    my concern is that  whilst the labour party and the conservative party will take a constructive approach to the debate  right wing political parties  picking up on statements like  burden to britain  will exploit this and create a lot of fear and uncertainty   it is precisely that concern   and the possible,news article

the law banning hunting with dogs in england and wales is enforceable and  very clear   alun michael has said  the rural affairs minister said it would become obvious if people flouted the law  which came into force on friday  and pretended they were not  some 270 hunts met legally on saturday killing a total of 91 foxes   only four were accidentally killed by hounds  but anti hunt campaigners said there had been widespread intimidation of activists monitoring hunts  countryside alliance chairman john jackson said that saturday had been a  massive demonstration by the rural community of support for hunting   people had turned out  to show en masse that the hunting act was a bad law   he said adding that foxes and other animals had been killed  legally  as far as he was aware  although hunting with dogs is now a criminal offence  exercising hounds  chasing a scent trail and flushing out foxes to be shot are still legal  addressing claims that the new law was unenforceable  mr michael told bbc radio 4 s today programme   there has been a lot of spin about this by those that support hunting   the reality is that the law is very clear  you can t chase wild mammals with a pack of dogs  whether the wild mammal is a fox or a deer   if people do so and pretend they re not it s going to become very clear  you can t hunt accidentally   mr michael also denied the hunting ban had led to a breakdown of trust between the government and rural communities  he said most people living in the countryside were more concerned with issues like the economy  the health service and their children s future than hunting  but the league against cruel sports claimed the new act had been broken even though the numbers of foxes killed had fallen  thousands of hunt supporters turned out at 270 hunts across england and wales on the first day of the ban  with anti hunt groups sending out 100 monitors to check the law was not being broken  there were only four arrests   over alleged hunting of hares in wiltshire   although it was not clear whether they were made under the hunting act  they have been released on bail but police say they may face prosecution under new poaching laws  but penny little  who monitored the bice,news article

which is more dangerous  a gun or a swimming pool  what do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common  why do drug dealers still live with their moms  how much do parents really matter  what kind of impact did roe v  wade have on violent crime  freakonomics will literally redefine the way we view the modern world these may not sound like typical questions for an economist to ask  but steven d  levitt is not a typical economist  he is a much heralded scholar who studies the stuff and riddles of everyday life    from cheating and crime to sports and child rearing    and whose conclusions regularly turn the conventional wisdom on its head  he usually begins with a mountain of data and a simple  unasked question  some of these questions concern life and death issues  others have an admittedly freakish quality  thus the new field of study contained in this book  freakonomics through forceful storytelling and wry insight  levitt and co author stephen j  dubner show that economics is  at root  the study of incentives    how people get what they want  or need  especially when other people want or need the same thing  in freakonomics  they set out to explore the hidden side of     well  everything  the inner workings of a crack gang  the truth about real estate agents  the myths of campaign finance  the telltale marks of a cheating schoolteacher  the secrets of the ku klux klan what unites all these stories is a belief that the modern world  despite a surfeit of obfuscation  complication  and downright deceit  is not impenetrable  is not unknowable  and    if the right questions are asked    is even more intriguing than we think  all it takes is a new way of looking  steven levitt  through devilishly clever and clear eyed thinking  shows how to see through all the clutter freakonomics establishes this unconventional premise  if morality represents how we would like the world to work  then economics represents how it actually does work  it is true that readers of this book will be armed with enough riddles and stories to last a thousand cocktail parties  but freakonomics can provide more than that  it will literally redefine the way we view the modern world  front flap,book description

the real danger is not what happens to your data as it crosses the net  argues analyst bill thompson  it is what happens when it arrives at the other end  the financial services authority has warned banks and other financial institutions that members of criminal gangs may be applying for jobs which give them access to confidential customer data  the fear is not that they will steal money from our bank accounts but that they will instead steal something far more valuable in our digital society   our identities  armed with the personal details that a bank holds  plus a fake letter or two  it is apparently easy to get a loan  open a bank account with an overdraft or get a credit card in someone else s name  and it is then a simple matter to move the money into another account and leave the unwitting victim to sort out the mess when statements and demands for payment start arriving  identity theft is an increasingly significant economic crime  and we are all becoming more aware of the dangers of leaving bills  receipts and bank statements unshredded in our rubbish  but  however careful you may be  if the organisations you trust with your personal data  bank accounts and credit cards are not able to look after their databases properly then you are in trouble  it is surprising that it has taken the gangs so long to realise that a well placed insider is by far the simplest way to break the security of a computer system  in fact  i suspect that the fsa is probably very late to this particular party and that this sort of thing has been going on for rather a long time  has anyone checked bob cratchit s family links to the criminal underworld  i wonder  and it is hardly likely to be only banks that are being targeted  health authorities  government agencies and of course the big e commerce sites like amazon must also offer rich pickings for the fraudsters  the good news is that better auditing is likely to catch out those who access account details that they are not supposed to  and as we all become aware of the danger of identity theft and look more carefully for unexpected transactions on our statements  banks should have good enough records and logs to trace the people who might have accessed t,news article

the arrival of new titles in the popular medal of honor and call of duty franchises leaves fans of wartime battle titles spoilt for choice  the acclaimed pc title call of duty has been updated for console formats  building on many of the original s elements  for its part  the long running medal of honor series has added pacific assault to its pc catalogue  adapting the console game rising sun  call of duty  finest hour casts you as a succession of allied soldiers fighting on world war 2 battlefronts including russia and north africa  it is a traditional first person viewed game that lets you control just one character  in the midst of a unit where cohorts constantly bark orders at you  on a near identical note  medal of honor  pacific assault does all it can to make you feel part of a tight knit team and plum in the middle of all out action  its arenas are the war s pacific battles  including guadalcanal and pearl harbour  you play one character throughout  a raw and rather talkative us soldier  both games rely on a carefully stage managed structure that keeps things ticking along  when this works  it is a brilliant device to make you feel part of a story  when it does not  it is tedious  a winning moment is an early scene in pacific assault  where you come under attack at the famous us base in hawaii  you are first ushered into a gunboat attacking the incoming waves of japanese planes  then made to descend into a sinking battleship to rescue crewman  before seizing the anti aircraft guns  it is one of the finest set pieces ever seen in a video game  this notion of shuffling the player along a studiously pre determined path  forcibly witnessing a series of pre set moments of action  is a perilous business which can make the whole affair feel stilted rather than organic  the genius of something like half life 2 is that it skilfully disguises its linear plotting by various means of misdirection  this pair of games do not really accomplish that  being more concerned with imparting a full on atmospheric experience  call of duty comes with a suitably bombastic score and overblown presentation  finest hour has a similar determination  framing everything in moody wartime music  archive footage,news article

in othello  shakespeare creates a powerful drama of a marriage that begins with fascination  between the exotic moor othello and the venetian lady desdemona   with elopement  and with intense mutual devotion and that ends precipitately with jealous rage and violent deaths  he sets this story in the romantic world of the mediterranean  moving the action from venice to the island of cyprus and giving it an even more exotic coloring with stories of othello s african past  shakespeare builds so many differences into his hero and heroine—differences of race  of age  of cultural background—that one should not  perhaps  be surprised that the marriage ends disastrously  but most people who see or read the play feel that the love that the play presents between othello and desdemona is so strong that it would have overcome all these differences were it not for the words and actions of othello s standard bearer  iago  who hates othello and sets out to destroy him by destroying his love for desdemona  as othello succumbs to iago s insinuations that desdemona is unfaithful  fascination—which dominates the early acts of the play—turns to horror  especially for the audience  we are confronted by spectacles of a generous and trusting othello in the grip of iago s schemes  of an innocent desdemona  who has given herself up entirely to her love for othello only to be subjected to his horrifying verbal and physical assaults  the outcome of othello s mistaken convictions about her faithlessness,book description

a group of mps and peers has called for a tightening of regulations controlling betting on sport  the parliamentary group on betting and gaming held a substantial inquiry into betting last year  it followed fears that a massive increase in betting on sport  such as that done using the internet and mobile phones  has led to more cheating  the all party group recommended 15 ways to protect punters and improve the integrity of sports betting  they include a proposal for raising the maximum jail sentence for gambling cheats above the current two years  lord condon  head of the international cricket council s anti corruption unit  who originally made the call for longer prison sentences  said the two year penalty was  derisory    you could get a bigger sentence for failing to pay your hotel bill criminally than you could for corruption in major sports   symbolically  a higher penalty  perhaps as the bill passes through the two houses  might be appropriate   the report recommended the governing bodies of sports have a say in the type of bets offered to punters  and for bookmakers to set up  audit trails    something the new betting exchanges already do   to allow suspicious betting patterns to be traced  lord faulkner of worcester  who chaired the inquiry  said   whilst we accept that the greater part of sports betting is neither corrupt nor unfair to punters  the evidence convinces us that the growth of betting exchanges   because of the facility they provide to bet against a result   has increased the potential for corruption   it is important that the government works with sporting administrators to review the difficulties faced by governing bodies in convicting the guilty and penalising them appropriately   the panel s aim was to try to define what constitutes cheating  assess how much might be going on and suggest what the government might do to put it right  as well as the growth of internet and mobile phone betting  there has been the creation of betting exchanges which allow punters to fix odds between themselves  betting exchanges allow punters to back  to win  but also lay  to lose  a horse  this means they can control their odds at winning by placing their money both ways,news article

faster  better or funkier hardware alone is not going to help phone firms sell more handsets  research suggests  instead  phone firms keen to get more out of their customers should not just be pushing the technology for its own sake  consumers are far more interested in how handsets fit in with their lifestyle than they are in screen size  onboard memory or the chip inside  shows an in depth study by handset maker ericsson   historically in the industry there has been too much focus on using technology   said dr michael bjorn  senior advisor on mobile media at ericsson s consumer and enterprise lab   we have to stop saying that these technologies will change their lives   he said   we should try to speak to consumers in their own language and help them see how it fits in with what they are doing   he told the bbc news website  for the study  ericsson interviewed 14 000 mobile phone owners on the ways they use their phone   people s habits remain the same   said dr bjorn   they just move the activity into the mobile phone as it s a much more convenient way to do it   one good example of this was diary writing among younger people  he said  while diaries have always been popular  a mobile phone    especially one equipped with a camera    helps them keep it in a different form  youngsters  use of text messages also reflects their desire to chat and keep in contact with friends and again just lets them do it in a slightly changed way  dr bjorn said that although consumers do what they always did but use a phone to do it  the sheer variety of what the new handset technologies make possible does gradually drive new habits and lifestyles  ericsson s research has shown that consumers divide into different  tribes  that use phones in different ways  dr bjorn said groups dubbed  pioneers  and  materialists  were most interested in trying new things and were behind the start of many trends in phone use   for instance   he said   older people are using sms much more than they did five years ago   this was because younger users  often the children of ageing mobile owners  encouraged older people to try it so they could keep in touch  another factor governing the speed of change in mobile phone use w,news article

a fresh delay has hit controversial new european union rules which govern computer based inventions  the draft law was not adopted by eu ministers as planned at a brussels meeting on monday during which it was supposed to have been discussed  the fresh delay came after polish officials had raised concerns about the law for the second time in two months  critics say the law would favour large companies over small ones and could impact open source software innovation   there was at one point the intention to put the item on today s agenda  but in the end we could not put it on   an eu spokesman told the reuters agency  he added that no date had been chosen for more discussion of the law  in december  poland requested more time to consider the issue because it was concerned that the law could lead to the patenting of pure computer software  its ministers want to see the phrasing of the text of the directive on the patentability of computer implemented inventions changed so that it excludes software patenting  poland is a large eu member  so its backing for the legislation is vital  the eu says the law would bring europe more in line with how such laws work in the us  but this has caused some angry debate amongst critics and supporters  in the us  the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted  this means that the us based amazon com holds a patent for its  one click shopping  service  critics say a similar model in europe would hurt small software developers which do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies  but supporters say current law does not let big companies protect inventions which they have spent years developing,news article

for an international manager  a friendly provides an important opportunity to work with your players  the only problem is that the game itself can often be a farce  some people have been saying it would be better to get the players together for the week  and do away with the 90 minutes at the end  i would say it s 50 50 whether you should have these games or not  and if you look at it that way you would probably say you re better not doing so  it would certainly keep club managers happy  as it would reduce the risk of players returning to domestic duty injured  but international bosses will tell you that scrapping friendlies is counterproductive because the only way for a team to get better is by playing  the more you play together  the easier it is when it comes to the crunch in games like world cup quarter finals against brazil  often in friendlies  though  a manager will play his strongest side for the first 45 minutes and then send out an entirely different one in the second half  and it s very difficult for any player to come on as substitute in a side with a few changes  let alone a whole team s worth  the debate will rage on  and i m not sure there is a satisfactory solution  one manager who has got it right this week is walter smith  the new scotland manager has decided to have a training camp instead of a friendly for his first international week since replacing berti vogts  it is the sort of move you would expect from walter  who is a canny manager  the players have had such a hard time recently that he is better off getting them together in a relaxed atmosphere and trying to generate some team spirit before the next world cup qualifiers  if he had sent them out on wednesday and they had been badly beaten  it would have done them no good whatsoever  john toshack has his first game in charge of wales  and it will be important for him to get a decent result against hungary  he will have his own ideas on individuals and how to play and will probably look more at the performance  but the public wants results  it s extremely difficult to get the balance for friendlies  if you win  people forget them  but if you lose it becomes a stat that can be used against you  england s game aga,news article

a user of apple s itunes music service is suing the firm saying it is unfair he can only use an ipod to play songs  he says apple is breaking anti competition laws in refusing to let other music players work with the site  apple  which opened its online store in 2003 after launching the ipod in 2001  uses technology to ensure each song bought only plays on the ipod  californian thomas slattery filed the suit in the us district court in san jose and is seeking damages   apple has turned an open and interactive standard into an artifice that prevents consumers from using the portable hard drive digital music player of their choice   the lawsuit states  the key to such a lawsuit would be convincing a court that a single brand like itunes is a market in itself separate from the rest of the online music market  according to ernest gellhorn  an anti trust law professor at george mason university   as a practical matter  the lower courts have been highly sceptical of such claims   prof gellhorn said  apple has sold more than six million ipods since the gadget was launched and has an 87  share of the market for portable digital music players  market research firm npd group has reported  more than 200 million songs have been sold by the itunes music store since it was launched   apple has unlawfully bundled  tied  and or leveraged its monopoly in the market for the sale of legal online digital music recordings to thwart competition in the separate market for portable hard drive digital music players  and vice versa   the lawsuit said  mr slattery called himself an itunes customer who  was also forced to purchase an apple ipod  if he wanted to take his music with him to listen to  a spokesman for apple declined to comment  apple s online music store uses a different format for songs than napster  musicmatch  realplayer and others  the rivals use the mp3 format or microsoft s wma format while apple uses aac  which it says helps thwart piracy  the wma format also includes so called digital rights management which is used to block piracy,news article

the dollar has hit its highest level against the euro in almost three months after the federal reserve head said the us trade deficit is set to stabilise  and alan greenspan highlighted the us government s willingness to curb spending and rising household savings as factors which may help to reduce it  in late trading in new york  the dollar reached  1 2871 against the euro  from  1 2974 on thursday  market concerns about the deficit has hit the greenback in recent months  on friday  federal reserve chairman mr greenspan s speech in london ahead of the meeting of g7 finance ministers sent the dollar higher after it had earlier tumbled on the back of worse than expected us jobs data   i think the chairman s taking a much more sanguine view on the current account deficit than he s taken for some time   said robert sinche  head of currency strategy at bank of america in new york   he s taking a longer term view  laying out a set of conditions under which the current account deficit can improve this year and next   worries about the deficit concerns about china do  however  remain  china s currency remains pegged to the dollar and the us currency s sharp falls in recent months have therefore made chinese export prices highly competitive  but calls for a shift in beijing s policy have fallen on deaf ears  despite recent comments in a major chinese newspaper that the  time is ripe  for a loosening of the peg  the g7 meeting is thought unlikely to produce any meaningful movement in chinese policy  in the meantime  the us federal reserve s decision on 2 february to boost interest rates by a quarter of a point   the sixth such move in as many months   has opened up a differential with european rates  the half point window  some believe  could be enough to keep us assets looking more attractive  and could help prop up the dollar  the recent falls have partly been the result of big budget deficits  as well as the us s yawning current account gap  both of which need to be funded by the buying of us bonds and assets by foreign firms and governments  the white house will announce its budget on monday  and many commentators believe the deficit will remain at close to half a trillion dollars,news article

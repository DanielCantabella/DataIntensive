chancellor gordon brown has announced a freeze on fuel duty in his pre budget speech to the commons on thursday  mr brown told the house that government policy is to raise fuel duty at least in line with inflation each year to fulfil environmental commitments  but this financial year  because of  volatility in the oil market   he said the duty would be frozen  during 2000 many motorists campaigned against the rises but environmentalists believe less duty means more pollution  he said   it is our policy that each year fuel duties should rise at least in line with inflation as we seek to meet our targets for reducing polluting emmissions and fund our public services   but this financial year because of the sustained volatility in the oil market i propose to match the freeze in car vehicle licence duty with a continuation on the freeze on the main road fuel duties   the rac welcomed the news  calling it an  early christmas present  for motorists  but the organisation urged drivers to continue to shop around to get the best price for petrol  environmental group transport 2000 said the freeze sends the wrong message to motorists   we are concerned that although britain leads the world in rhetoric about climate change it often fails in practical action   said a spokesman  in 2000 the people s fuel lobby caused chaos by blocking roads with slow moving convoys after mr brown threatened to raise fuel taxes  the chancellor did not raise duty that year  but despite threats of more protests in 2003  he added 1 28p per litre,news article

german investment bank deutsche bank has challenged the right of yukos to claim bankruptcy protection in the us  in a court filing on tuesday  it said the russian oil giant has few texas ties beyond bank accounts and a texas based finance chief  deutsche bank claimed yukos had artificially manufactured a legal case to stop the sale of its main asset  it had wanted to help fund gazprom s plans for a  10bn  £5 18bn  bid for yukos unit yuganskneftegas  deutsche bank would have earned large fees from the deal  which could not be carried out because us chapter 11 bankruptcy rules made the kremlin s auction of yuganskneftegas on 19 december illegal under us law  but the us bankruptcy court judge in texas granted yukos an injunction that barred gazprom and its lenders from taking part  yuganskneftegas will ultimately end up with gazprom  the winning bidder at the auction was a previously unknown firm  baikal finance group  which was snapped up days later by rosneft  a russian oil firm that is in the process of merging with gazprom  the effect of these transactions is to renationalise yuganskneftegas  deutsche bank contends yukos filed for bankruptcy earlier this month in texas in a desperate and unsuccessful bid to stave off the 19 december auction of its top unit by the russian government  which was in a tax dispute with yukos   this blatant attempt to artificially manufacture a basis for jurisdiction constitutes cause to dismiss this case   deutsche bank said in its court filing  mike lake  a spokesman for yukos  lawyers  said on tuesday that the company stands by its legal action  yukos is confident of its right to us bankruptcy protection  and  we are prepared to be back in court defending that position again   he said  yukos has said it intends to seek  20bn in damages from the buyer of yuganskneftegas once the sale finally goes through  in its filing  deutsche bank said houston was  a jurisdiction in which yukos owns no real or personal property and conducts no business operations   it also said the us bankruptcy court should not become involved in  a tax dispute between the federation and one of its corporate citizens   it suggested the european court or an international arbitration tribunal were more appropriate jurisdictions for the legal fight between russia and yukos,news article

home printed pictures can be cheaper and higher quality than those from high street developers  tests shows  a survey carried out by pc pro magazine looked at which of 100 home photo printers offered a better deal than handing your snaps to a photo lab  the tests found that images from top pc printers kept their colour longer than professionally produced photographs  but using the wrong printer cartridge could means snaps fade in months  warned the magazine  the group test of 100 home photo printers for pcs discovered how much it costs to create images using the devices compared to online developers as well as high street names such as jessops  boots and snappy snaps  the comprehensive test also revealed how quickly different printers produced images  the quality of the finished image and how resistant finished pictures were to smudging or water damage  it found that although some ink for printers now costs more than £2 per millilitre it can still be cheaper to produce prints from photographs at home than it is to send them off to a high street store   if you really like your photos  then it s definitely worth printing at home instead of going to the high street  but only if you choose the right printer   said nick ross  top tester at pc pro  mr ross said that a new generation of printers produced images with brighter colours and that were less likely to fade than many high street developers or even some professional wedding photographers  some high street photo shops can be the cheapest when it came to developing prints that were 6x4in  said mr ross  but the test revealed that images 7x5in and 8x10in in size were cheaper to produce at home  according to pc pro  producing a print 8x10in on an epson r800 printer using top quality paper costs £1 87  at jessops the same image would cost £2 50 and at snappy snaps £9 99  a 10x7in snap at boots would cost £4 99   considering how inconvenient it can be to go to the high street and how silver halide prints can fade in the sun  we re adamant that it s now better  cheaper and more convenient to print at home   he said  ann simpson  marketing manager at snappy snaps believes the convenience of high street printing will continue to attract customers   some people will want to do their own thing on their computer but the feedback to u,news article

public trust in taxes is breaking down because labour and tories are not being straight with people on the issue  lib dem leader charles kennedy has said  a day ahead of the government s pre budget report  mr kennedy used a speech to say his party was facing up to  painful economic realities   he said the current level of taxation was about right  although he would put a new 50  tax on top earners  other parties have accused the lib dems of making uncosted promises  mr kennedy made it clear he was determined to counter that accusation  the lib dems have already published what they say are the full costings for all their plans and wednesday s speech did not announce new policies  speaking at the commonwealth club  mr kennedy said it was critical for a political party to have economic credibility  both on what it promised and what it was expected to deliver  he said   budgets have to add up  tough choices are needed in public spending   the lib dems would cut  low priority  spending  including the government s id cards scheme and the child trust fund  those cutbacks would free up funds for increasing basic state pensions for over 75s  putting more police on the streets and reintroducing fee eye and dental checks  he said  the lib dems argue they were honest about taxes in the past by calling for a 1p rise on income tax  now they say the only simple tax rise they want is a new 50  tax band for top earners to pay for scrapping university tuition fees  providing free personal care for elderly and disabled people and keeping local taxes down  there would also be a local income tax to replace council tax and a number of changes to environmental taxes to ensure it is the  polluter who pays   the lib dems say the tories have only laid out possible options for cutting taxes to grab headlines while labour has hidden most of its tax rises  mr kennedy said   that contract with the people   that the government will only tax fairly and will spend their money wisely   can only be sustained if the political parties are straightforward about their plans   with the stealth tax strategy of gordon brown  the obvious unfairness of our current tax system   especially the council tax  and the empty promises of the conservative party on this issue   it is no wonder that trust in taxation is break,news article

the growth in the mobile phone market in the past decade has been nothing less than astonishing  but the ability to communicate on the go is not the only reason we are hooked  games  cameras and music players have all been added to our handsets in the last few years  but 2005 could see another big innovation that won t just see a change in our mobile phone habits   it might alter the way we listen to the radio  finnish handset giant nokia has been working on a technology called visual radio  which takes an existing fm signal from a radio station and enables that station to add enhancements such as information and pictures  it is not the first time that such an idea has been suggested   the early days of dab digital radio had similar intentions that never really saw the light of day  one problem is that the name visual radio leads people to think of television but reidar wasenius  a senior project manager at nokia  was adamant that visual radio should not be confused with the more traditional medium  he said   i m very happy to say it s not television  what we re talking about is an enhancement of radio as we know it today   if you have a visual radio enabled handset  when you hear an artist you don t know  or there s a competition or vote that you d like to participate in  you pull out your handset and with one click you turn on a visual channel parallel to the on air broadcast you ve just been listening to   that visual channel is run from a computer within the radio station  and sends out different kinds of information to the handset depending on what you are listening to  as well as details on the track or artist of a particular song  there is also the ability to interact immediately with the radio station itself  in a similar way to digital television s  red button  content  possible interactive content includes competitions  votes and even the chance to rate the song that is playing  but the interactive aspect will make the service especially attractive to radio stations  who will be able to track the number of people taking part in such activities on a real time basis  this in turn should lead to an additional source of revenue  as it is very likely that advertisers will be keen to exploit new opportunities to reach listeners  as the visual radio content is transmit,news article

a proposed european law on software patents will not be re drafted by the european commission  ec  despite requests by meps  the law is proving controversial and has been in limbo for a year  some major tech firms say it is needed to protect inventions  while others fear it will hurt smaller tech firms the ec says the council of ministers will adopt a draft version that was agreed upon last may but said it would review  all aspects of the directive   the directive is intended to offer patent protection to inventions that use software to achieve their effect  in other words   computer implemented invention   in a letter  ec president jos  233  manuel barroso told the president of the european parliament  josep borrell  that the commission  did not intend to refer a new proposal to the parliament and the council  of ministers   as it had supported the agreement reached by ministers in may 2004  if the european council agrees on the draft directive it will then return for a second reading at the european parliament  but that will not guarantee that the directive will become law   instead it will probably mean further delays and controversy over the directive  most eu legislation now needs the approval of both parliament and the council of ministers before it becomes law  french green mep alain lipietz warned two weeks ago that if the commission ignored the parliament s request it would be an  insult  to the assembly  he said that the parliament would then reject the council s version of the legislation as part of the final or conciliation stage of the decision procedure  in the us  the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted  this means that the us based amazon com holds a patent for its  one click shopping  service  for example  critics are concerned that the directive could lead to a similar model happening in europe  this  they fear  could hurt small software developers because they do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies if they had to fight patent legal action in court  supporters say current laws are inefficient and it would serve to even up a playing field without bringing eu laws in line with the us,news article

gordon brown has made an appeal for unity after reports claimed mr blair went back on a pledge to stand down before the next general election  the chancellor would not comment on the reports  but insisted he would not be  diverted or distracted  from tackling the challenges faced by the country  his only  motivation  was to ensure labour was re elected  he insisted  mr blair earlier dismissed the claim he had reneged on a promise to stand aside for gordon brown as old news  according to a new book  brown s britain by sunday telegraph journalist robert peston  mr blair went back on a pledge to make way for mr brown after cabinet allies intervened in june 2004  in an interview with bbc one s breakfast with frost  mr blair said   i ve dealt with this six months ago  i said then you don t do deals over jobs like this   you don t   what both of us are actually concentrating on are the issues that concern the country   in a separate interview with bbc political editor andrew marr  mr brown said   it s very important that we all do what we can in a unified way to ensure the election of a labour government   i think it is very important to stress that that is the motivation that i have   that is my purpose in politics  and that is what every day i seek to do  and i am not going to be diverted or distracted  nor is tony blair  by newspaper stories or books or rumours or gossip   the only reason why we are in government is to get on with the job in a unified way to deal with the challenges facing this country   mr brown also said he had discussed the general election campaign with the prime minister on saturday and pledged to play his part as he had been asked to do  but mr peston said the pair had  mutual animosity and contempt  for each other and that mr blair had decided in november 2003 he would quit because he felt he had lost voters  trust because of the iraq war  he then changed his mind in june 2004  following intervention from allies in the cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him  according to the book  andrew marr said   this is enormously damaging  gordon brown knows it as well as tony blair   i think the relationship is genuinely  privately  very poor indeed  things are very difficult   he added   lots of ministers believe,news article

a major government department is without e mail for a week  and technology analyst bill thompson wants to know what happened  a couple of weeks ago i wrote about how my girlfriend had suffered when her cable modem blew up and she was offline for several days  it seems that thousands of civil servants at the uk s department of work and pensions went through the same thing last week  it has emerged that the internal network crashed in a particularly horrible way  depriving staff of e mail and access to the application software they use to calculate people s benefit and pension entitlement or note changes in personal circumstances  senior consultants from eds  the computer firm which manage the system  and microsoft  which supplied the software  were running around trying to figure out what had to be done to fix it all  while staff resorted to phone  fax and probably carrier pigeon to get work done  fortunately the back office systems which actually pay people their money were still working  so only new claims and updates were affected done properly  this is bad enough for those affected  but it does mean that the impact is not devastating for millions of pensioners  i am sure regular readers will be expecting one of my usual diatribes against poor software  badly specified systems and inadequate disaster recovery plans  although the full story has not yet been told  it seems that the problem started when a plan to upgrade some of the computers from windows 2000 to windows xp went wrong  and xp code was inadvertently copied to thousands of machines across the network  this is certainly unfortunate  but i have a lot of sympathy for the network managers and technology staff involved  today s computer networks are large  complex and occasionally fragile  the interconnectedness that we all value also gives us a degree of instability and unpredictability that we cannot design out of the systems  it is the network equivalent of godel s theorem   any system sufficiently complex to be useful is also able to collapse catastrophically  so i will reserve judgment on the technology aspects until we all know what actually happened and whether it was a consequence of software failure or just bad luck  what is really disturbing  and cannot be excused  is the fact that it took four days for,news article

the risk of pets and children being given votes could be cut by changing how people register to vote  the uk elections watchdog has said  those are some of the mistakes found under the current system  where one person in each household applies for voting forms for the other occupants  the electoral commission says enabling people to register individually could cut some errors and combat fraud  voters need to register by 11 march if the next poll is on 5 may as expected  but any individual registration scheme would not be introduced in britain before that general election  the proposed scheme would mean voters using individual  identifiers  when they vote   such as their own voting number  date of birth and signature  the electoral commission says having voters register individually rather than the head of household do it for them fits better with human rights laws  chairman sam younger told mps on tuesday care was needed to ensure that people were not lost off the register in the process   which happened when northern ireland switched to a similar system  there have been rare cases when household pets have been put on the electoral roll  the mps heard  and some people have registered all their family  regardless of their age   birth dates are not included on the forms so election officers cannot easily check  non british citizens who are not entitled to vote have also been registered in some cases  mr younger said there was anecdotal evidence of inaccuracies in the register  the vast majority of which were caused by genuine mistakes  he argued local councils could look harder at promoting targeted campaigns at  hard to reach  voters  for example  some authorities already run such programmes but in others councillors worry about the party political impact of encouraging particular areas to turn out  mr younger said using the royal mail s postal redirection service had already helped election officers retrace about 50 000 voters  he argued individual registration would also increase security for postal ballots and other new ways of voting  there have been fears there are too few checks to ensure current postal votes are cast by the person on the voting form  he said it might also help register students in halls of residences  where the hall warden often has to do the job fo,news article

xyz re  abc medical record   123 dear dr  xyz  i saw abc back in neuro oncology clinic today  he comes in for an urgent visit because of increasing questions about what to do next for his anaplastic astrocytoma  within the last several days  he has seen you in clinic and once again discussed whether or not to undergo radiation for his left temporal lesion  the patient has clearly been extremely ambivalent about this therapy for reasons that are not immediately apparent  it is clear that his mri is progressing and that it seems unlikely at this time that anything other than radiation would be particularly effective  despite repeatedly emphasizing this  however  the patient still is worried about potential long term side effects from treatment that frankly seem unwarranted at this particular time  after seeing you in clinic  he and his friend again wanted to discuss possible changes in the chemotherapy regimen  they came in with a list of eight possible agents that they would like to be administered within the next two weeks  they then wanted another mri to be performed and they were hoping that with the use of this type of approach  they might be able to induce another remission from which he can once again be spared radiation  from my view  i noticed a man whose language has deteriorated in the week since i last saw him  this is very worrisome  today  for the first time  i felt that there was a definite right facial droop as well  therefore  there is no doubt that he is becoming symptomatic from his growing tumor  it suggests that he is approaching the end of his compliance curve and that the things may rapidly deteriorate in the near future  emphasizing this once again  in addition  to recommending steroids i once again tried to convince him to undergo radiation  despite an hour  this again amazingly was not possible  it is not that he does not want treatment  however  because i told him that i did not feel it was ethical to just put him on the radical regimen that him and his friend devised  we compromised and elected to go back to temodar in a low dose daily type regimen  we would plan on giving 75 mg sq m everyday for 21 days out of 28 days  in addition  we will stop thalidomide 100 mg day  if he tolerates this for one week  we then agree that we would institute anoth,medical transcript

the original blinx was intended to convert many platform game lovers to microsoft s then new xbox console  its sharp graphics and novel gameplay  with the main character able to pause  slow  rewind and fast forward time  were meant to lure many fans to the new machine  but poor design meant the game became a very frustrating affair with players often stranded half way through a level without the required tools to finish  thankfully  the sequel has fixed many of the original faults  this time around you do not play as blinx but instead you are given the chance to create two unique cat characters and two pig characters  the character generator is very detailed and a few minutes of tweaking and adjusting will create a unique personality to unleash on the game  as the game progresses you swap between the two rival factions  pig and feline  assuming the role of your created characters  the thrust of the game sees the two factions competing to recover pieces of a missing time crystal  as in the original  your feline persona can control time  but this time the pigs get to control space  there are a number of puzzles which require control over time to solve while the pigs can create things such as warps  space bubbles and void traps in order to progress  the control over space and time is achieved through a number of vcr style icons and is quite intuitive  annoyingly  the puzzles are a little too obviously flagged up and most gamers will find it more of a chore than a challenge to solve them  the game has also tried to emulate franchises such as jak and daxter and ratchet and clank on ps2 and so there are a number of combat elements  these are a little predictable and tend to drag the general polish of the game down to a more dulled affair  but the game s excellent graphics  easily the best looking platform game around  sound and dollops of humour make it an attractive game for younger platform fans  blinx 2 is out on xbox now,news article

a cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet  the elections watchdog has said  fears that big donors can buy political favours have sparked calls for a limit  in a new report  the electoral commission says it is worth debating a £10 000 cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it  it also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning  there were almost £68m in reported donations to political parties in 2001  2002 and 2003  with nearly £12m of them from individual gifts worth more than £1m  the rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions  the commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash   something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work   while we are not in principle opposed to the introduction of a donation cap  we do not believe that such a major departure from the existing system now would be sensible   says its report  if there was to be a cap  it should be £10 000   a small enough amount to make a difference but which would have banned £56m in donations between 2001 and 2003  even without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more small scale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under £200  it also suggests increasing state funding for parties to £3m so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the house of commons  european parliament  scottish parliament  welsh assembly or northern ireland assembly  and it suggests new ways of boosting election campaigning  seen as a way of improving voter turnout  all local election candidates should be entitled to a free mailshot for campaign leaflets  says the watchdog  and there should be a shift in the amount of money allowed to be spent at elections from a national level to a local level to help politicians engage better with voters  the report suggests doubling the money which can be spent by candidates  while cutting national spending limits from £20m to £15m  the commission also says the spending limits for general elections should cover the four months bef,news article

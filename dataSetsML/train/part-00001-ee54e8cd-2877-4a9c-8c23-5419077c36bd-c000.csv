surfers outside the us have been unable to visit the official re election site of president george w bush  the blocking of browsers sited outside the us began in the early hours of monday morning  since then people outside the us trying to browse the site get a message saying they are not authorised to view it  the blocking does not appear to be due to an attack by vandals or malicious hackers  but as a result of a policy decision by the bush camp  the international exclusion zone around georgewbush com was spotted by net monitoring firm netcraft which keeps an eye on traffic patterns across many different sites  netcraft said that since the early hours of 25 october attempts to view the site through its monitoring stations in london  amsterdam and sydney failed  by contrast netcraft s four monitoring stations in the us managed to view the site with no problems  the site can still be seen using anonymous proxy services that are based in the us  some web users in canada also report that they can browse the site  the pattern of traffic to the website suggests that the blocking was not due to an attack by vandals or politically motivated hackers  geographic blocking works because the numerical addresses that the net uses to organise itself are handed out on a regional basis  on 21 october  the george w bush website began using the services of a company called akamai to ensure that the pages  videos and other content on its site reaches visitors  mike prettejohn  president of netcraft  speculated that the blocking decision might have been taken to cut costs  and traffic  in the run up to the election on 2 november  he said the site may see no reason to distribute content to people who will not be voting next week  managing traffic could also be a good way to ensure that the site stays working in the closing days of the election campaign  however  simply blocking non us visitors also means that americans overseas are barred too  akamai declined to comment  saying it could not talk about customer websites,news article

a fresh delay has hit controversial new european union rules which govern computer based inventions  the draft law was not adopted by eu ministers as planned at a brussels meeting on monday during which it was supposed to have been discussed  the fresh delay came after polish officials had raised concerns about the law for the second time in two months  critics say the law would favour large companies over small ones and could impact open source software innovation   there was at one point the intention to put the item on today s agenda  but in the end we could not put it on   an eu spokesman told the reuters agency  he added that no date had been chosen for more discussion of the law  in december  poland requested more time to consider the issue because it was concerned that the law could lead to the patenting of pure computer software  its ministers want to see the phrasing of the text of the directive on the patentability of computer implemented inventions changed so that it excludes software patenting  poland is a large eu member  so its backing for the legislation is vital  the eu says the law would bring europe more in line with how such laws work in the us  but this has caused some angry debate amongst critics and supporters  in the us  the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted  this means that the us based amazon com holds a patent for its  one click shopping  service  critics say a similar model in europe would hurt small software developers which do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies  but supporters say current law does not let big companies protect inventions which they have spent years developing,news article

deaf people who prefer to communicate using british sign language  bsl  could soon be having their phone conversations relayed using webcams or videophones and an interpreter  the video relay service is being piloted by the royal national institute for deaf people  rnid   but the organisation says unless the service is provided at the same rate as voice calls it will be beyond most people s pockets  the rnid is urging telecoms regulator  ofcom  to reduce the cost of the service from the current £7 00 per minute and make it the same as ordinary phone calls  the service works by putting a deaf person in visual contact with a bsl interpreter via a webcam or video phone  and the interpreter then relays the deaf person s conversation using a telephone and translates the other person s response into sign language  for many deaf people  especially those born deaf  bsl is a first and preferred means of communication  until now  the only alternative has been to use textphones which means having to type a message and have it relayed via an operator   in the past  i ve used textphones but they have problems   said robert currington who is taking part in the pilot   i communicate in bsl  my written english is not very good and it takes me longer to think in english and type my message    i sometimes find it difficult to understand the reply   the rnid says the uk is lagging behind other countries which are already making relay services available at the cost of an ordinary phone call   there are no technical or economic reasons for not providing equivalent access to services for deaf people   said rnid technology director  guido gybels   in the us and australia  sign language relay services have already been made universally available at the same cost as a voice call   by failing to provide and fund the video relay service for sign language users  the telecommunications sector is effectively discriminating against an already disenfranchised group   ofcom says it has plans to review the services that telecoms companies are obliged to provide early next year  and new technology  including the video relay service  will be discussed with interested parties in the near future  but a spokesman said its powers were limited by legislation   any proposals to extend existing arrangements to cov,news article
about 20 000 people have been banned from playing the half life 2 game  game maker valve shut down the online accounts of the players because it had evidence that their copy of the game had been obtained illegally  copies of half life 2 had been circulating on file sharing systems soon after it was officially released  experts said the success of the half life 2 anti piracy system might tempt other game makers into creating their own version  half life 2 was officially released on 16 november but before gamers could get to grips with the long awaited title they were forced to authenticate their copy of the game online  authentication involved setting up an account with valve s gaming community system called steam and letting that check which copy of the game was being run  in a statement detailing the banning of the accounts valve said this system helped identify who had got hold of pirated copies   the method used was extremely easy for valve to trace and confirm  and so there is no question that the accounts disabled were used to try and illegally obtain half life 2   read the statement  valve spokesman doug lombardi said that the company had not yet released sales figures for the game and would not say what proportion of all steam players the 20 000 represented  one effect of steam s popularity has been to limit the copies of the game sold in shops and artificially depress the game s ranking in the top ten  even so the title debuted at no 3 in the uk charts  valve also said that a small number of accounts were closed because people were using stolen credit cards to buy copies of the game or were using stolen steam accounts  some of those who have been banned by the move protested their innocence in the online forums on the main steam site and said they were being punished for what other people did with their account  some contributors to the forums wondered if the action might force more piracy as people tried to get hold of successive copies of the game to keep ahead of valve s anti piracy actions  in its statement valve also said that rumours that it distributed fake half life 2 keys  copies of the game or instructions on how to hack the game  just to catch pirates and cheats were false  the company said   the hack came from the  community  as do they all   it added,news article

charles kennedy has told voters his liberal democrats will offer them an  honest choice  at the next general election  with the other two big parties battling over which will impose the lowest taxes  mr kennedy is going into the looming election pledged to increase taxation  it is a bold policy and certainly ensures there is that choice between the lib dems and the other two  with his party s previous pledge to increase taxes by one penny in the pound to spend on public services already adopted by the government  he has switched tack  now he is promising to levy a  modest  increase of the same amount on earnings over £100 000 a year to allow him to finance a series of pledges  they are to scrap student fees  finance free long term care for the elderly and replace the council tax with a local income tax  that last policy will also see about 3  of the most well off paying more while others  pensioners in particular  will pay less  labour and the tories have attacked his policies as both unworkable and not properly costed  inevitably they insist there is no need to raise taxes to fund improvements in services  the tories claim they can improve services and cut taxes through £35bn efficiency savings  while labour has offered £22bn savings but has yet to map out precise tax proposals  although there is little chance they will propose increases  in many ways the argument between the lib dems and the others over taxation and spending echo the sort of arguments that raged between labour and the tories in the 1980s and early 1990s  but  unlike the old tory labour debate  he believes voters are ready to see  modest  tax increases on the well off in order to fund improvements in services  that is a view partly endorsed by recent polls suggesting people would rather have cash spent on public services than tax cuts  similarly there is a different tone to the lib dem approach to asylum and immigration  with mr kennedy stressing politicians should not  foment an artificial debate  about immigration and attacking michael howard s proposals for quotas  once again  with the two other big parties singing similar songs on immigration  mr kennedy is stressing the different  more liberal approach of his party  mr kennedy was also in buoyant mood over his party s election chances  declaring the,news article

cash machine networks could soon be more susceptible to computer viruses  a security firm has warned  the warning is being issued because many banks are starting to use the windows operating system in machines  already there have been four incidents in which windows viruses have disrupted networks of cash machines running the microsoft operating system  but banking experts say the danger is being overplayed and that the risks of infection and disruption are small  for many years the venerable ibm operating system  known as os 2  has been the staple software used to power many of the 1 4m cash machines in operation around the world  but ibm will end support for os 2 in 2006 which is forcing banks to look for alternatives  there are also other pressures making banks turn to windows said dominic hirsch  managing director of financial analysis firm retail banking research  he said many cash machines will also have to be upgraded to make full use of the new europay  mastercard and visa credit cards that use computer chips instead of magnetic stripes to store data  us laws that demand disabled people get equal access to information will also force banks to make their cash machines more versatile and able to present information in different ways  todd thiemann  spokesman for anti virus firm trend micro  said the move to windows in cash machines was not without risks  mr thiemann said research by the towergroup showed that 70  of new cash machines being installed were windows based  already  he said  there have been four incidents in which cash machines have been unavailable for hours due to viruses affecting the network of the bank that owns them  in january 2003 the slammer worm knocked out 13 000 cash machines of the bank of america and many of those operated by the canadian imperial bank of commerce  in august of the same year  cash machines of two un named banks were put out of action for hours following an infection by the welchia worm  incidents like this happen  said mr thiemann  because when banks start using windows cash machines they also change the networking technology used to link the devices to their back office computers  this often means that all the cash machines and computers in a bank share the same data network   this could mean that cash machines get caught,news article

this book is a long awaited major statement by a pre eminent analytic philosopher  alvin plantinga  on one of our biggest debates    the compatibility of science and religion  the last twenty years has seen a cottage industry of books on this divide  but with little consensus emerging  plantinga  as a top philosopher but also a proponent of the rationality of religious belief  has a unique contribution to make  his theme in this short book is that the conflict between science and theistic religion is actually superficial  and that at a deeper level they are in concord plantinga examines where this conflict is supposed to exist    evolution  evolutionary psychology  analysis of scripture  scientific study of religion    as well as claims by dan dennett  richard dawkins  and philip kitcher that evolution and theistic belief cannot co exist  plantinga makes a case that their arguments are not only inconclusive but that the supposed conflicts themselves are superficial  due to the methodological naturalism used by science  on the other hand  science can actually offer support to theistic doctrines  and plantinga uses the notion of biological and cosmological  fine tuning  in support of this idea  plantinga argues that we might think about arguments in science and religion in a new way    as different forms of discourse that try to persuade people to look at questions from a perspective such that they can see that something is true  in this way  there is a deep and massive consonance between theism and the scientific enterprise,book description

ministers have insisted they are committed to free personal care for the elderly despite research suggesting the cost of the policy was under estimated  a report by the fraser of allander institute says the decision to push ahead with the flagship policy was based on flawed research  deputy health minister rhona brankin has pledged to study the research  snp holyrood leader nicola sturgeon said the public needed reassurance that the care programme was secure  the rise in costs stems from a series of mistakes in the research used by the  care development group  of scottish executive experts who prepared the original costings  according to findings published in the quarterly economic commentary of strathclyde university s fraser of allander institute   dubious  assumptions about improving health expectancy could drive the cost of the policy up by another £130m by 2022  the report warned  it was carried out by husband and wife economist team jim and margaret cuthbert  but ms brankin told bbc radio scotland   we don t think we got our sums wrong   obviously we will examine the findings of this new report  along with figures from our own research that we have already commissioned   we will look in great detail at any contribution to this  because we need to be sure we can provide free personal care and nursing care for our older people into the future   and we are absolutely committed to doing that   but the scottish national party called on ministers to reassure people that enough funding is in place to support the free personal care policy  ms sturgeon said that while she had no reason to doubt the executive s support for the policy  there were questions which needed to be answered and  if necessary  sums redone  she said   serious concerns have been raised and there are questions which need to be answered by the scottish executive   we need to know that the money is there  not just for this year or next year  but into the future so that older people  and those who are looking forward to older age  can rest assured that their personal care needs will be met,news article

more lives than previously thought could be saved by cutting drink drive limits by a third  a report says  university college london research claims cutting the limit from 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood to 50mg would save 65 lives a year  the findings are being published by the parliamentary advisory council for transport safety as mps are due to vote on the government s road safety bill  the bill includes changes to speeding fines but not to the drink drive limit  the research  carried out by transport expert professor richard allsop  says cutting the limit would also lead to 230 fewer serious injuries on the uk s roads compared with 2003  he estimates that this would save the country £119m a year  a previous estimate  contained in a 1998 department of transport document  suggested such a move could save 50 lives a year  the findings are based on the assumption that drivers who currently keep below the legal limit would continue to do so were it to be lowered and that those who tend to exceed the limit slightly would also lower their drinking  professor allsop said   reducing the limit from 80mg to 50mg can be expected to save around 65 lives a year or around half of those who die in accidents where the driver s bac  blood alcohol content  is within 30mg of the current limit   only about one in 50 of those driving during weekend evenings and nights will need to moderate their drinking to achieve this and fewer still at other times   ministers do not support a lower limit  saying it is not clear it would have a major impact on drink drive casualties  they believe educating drivers is more important  the aa motoring trust said it was not sure what affect dropping the limit would have on drivers  attitudes to drink driving  road safety head andrew howard said   it remains to be seen whether the social disapproval of the drinking driver will stay at the current rate if the alcohol limit is cut   parliamentarians need to consider this carefully  britons police themselves by consensus much more effectively than they do by weight of enforcement alone   liberal democrat transport spokesman john thurso said drink driving remained a  major killer   with figures showing a worrying rise in the number of accidents involving drivers who had been drinking  he said there had been a,news article

the hi tech industry is starting to get more environmentally aware  bill thompson thinks it s about time  my first car ran on four star petrol and pumped vast quantities of lead into the atmosphere as i drove around cambridge  now you can t buy petrol with lead additives  and we re all better off as a result  chip giant intel recently began shipping computer circuit boards that are lead free too  reflecting a growing awareness on the part of the technology industry that products have to be designed and built in more environmentally friendly ways  apart from reducing the use of toxic materials like arsenic  mercury  cadmium and other heavy metals in the products themselves  the manufacturing process is also being cleaned up  with fewer complex and potentially damaging organic chemicals used as solvents  and work is going into making power supplies that are more energy efficient  since current transformers are astonishingly wasteful as they charge our laptops  mobiles and music players  one of the key aspects of the new approach is to design products that are easier to recycle  if you have got a phone or a computer with toxic chemicals or heavy metals in it then extracting them can be tricky and expensive  a well designed electronic component is able to be recycled at low cost  this is going to be very important to hardware manufacturers in europe since from august the new waste electronic and electrical equipment directive will oblige them to accept returned products for recycling  they will end up paying if they build things that are expensive or impossible to take apart and will find their profits hit  something which is likely to motivate them where appeals to the wider public interest might fall on deaf ears  it is  as they say  about time  we have a long and depressing history of developing new technologies with complete disregard for their potential impact on the environment  and waiting until there is a crisis looming before we try to redesign them to cause less damage  the car engine is a case in point  lead additives helped stop petrol vapour exploding too early in the cylinder  a phenomenon called  knocking   so they were simply used without any real thought for the fact that the lead would end up in the atmosphere  redesigning engines and making petrol slightly,news article

the official re election site of president george w bush is blocking visits from overseas users for  security reasons   the blocking began early on monday so those outside the us and trying to view the site got a message saying they are not authorised to view it  but keen net users have shown that the policy is not being very effective  many have found that the site can still be viewed by overseas browsers via several alternative net addresses  the policy of trying to stop overseas visitors viewing the site is thought to have been adopted in response to an attack on the georgewbush com website  scott stanzel  a spokesman for the bush cheney campaign said   the measure was taken for security reasons   he declined to elaborate any further on the blocking policy  the barring of non us visitors has led to the campaign being inundated with calls and forced it to make a statement about why the blocking was taking place  in early october a so called  denial of service  attack was mounted on the site that bombarded it with data from thousands of pcs  the attack made the site unusable for about five hours  about the same time the web team of the bush cheney campaign started using the services of a company called akamai that helps websites deal with the ebbs and flows of visitor traffic  akamai uses a web based tool called edgescape that lets its customers work out where visitors are based  typically this tool is used to ensure that webpages  video and images load quickly but it can also be used to block traffic  geographic blocking works because the numerical addresses that the net uses to organise itself are handed out on a regional basis  readers of the boingboing weblog have found that viewers can still get at the site by using alternative forms of the george w bush domain name  ironically one of the working alternatives is for a supposedly more secure version of the site  there are now at least three working alternative domains for the bush cheney campaign that let web users outside the us visit the site  the site can also be seen using anonymous proxy services that are based in the us  some web users in canada also report that they can browse the site  the international exclusion zone around georgewbush com was spotted by net monitoring firm netcraft which keeps an eye on tra,news article

do we imagine english history as a book with white pages and no black letters in  we sometimes think of tudor england in terms of gaudy costumes  the court of henry viii and elizabeth i and perhaps shakespearian romance  onyeka s book acknowledges this predilection but challenges our perceptions  onyeka s book is about the presence  status and origins of africans in tudor england  in it onyeka argues that these people were present in cities and towns throughout england  but that they did not automatically occupy the lowest positions in tudor society  this is important because the few modern historians who have written about africans in tudor england suggest that they were all slaves  or transient immigrants who were considered as dangerous strangers and the epitome of otherness  however  this book will show that some africans in england had important occupations in tudor society  and were employed by powerful people because of the skills they possessed  these people seem to have inherited some of their skills from the multicultural societies that they came from  but that does not mean all of those present in england were born in other countries  some were born in england  the arguments in this book are supported by evidence from a variety of sources both manuscript and printed  most of which has not been widely discussed   whilst some of it onyeka has discovered  and this may be the first time that it has been revealed  other evidence is taken from texts that are the subject of popular discussion by historians  linguists and so on  but onyeka encourages the reader to re examine these works in a different way because they reveal information about the presence  status and origins of africans in tudor england,book description

plans to extend paid maternity leave beyond six months should be prominent in labour s election manifesto  the trade and industry secretary has said  patricia hewitt said the cost of the proposals was being evaluated  but it was an  increasingly high priority  and a  shared goal across government   ms hewitt was speaking at a gender and productivity seminar organised by the equal opportunities commission  eoc   mothers can currently take up to six months  paid leave   and six unpaid  ms hewitt told the seminar   clearly  one of the things we need to do in the future is to extend the period of payment for maternity leave beyond the first six months into the second six months   we are looking at how quickly we can do that  because obviously there are cost implications because the taxpayer reimburses the employers for the cost of that   ms hewitt also announced a new drive to help women who want to work in male dominated sectors  saying sexism at work was still preventing women reaching their full potential  plans include funding for universities to help female science and engineering graduates find jobs and  taster courses  for men and women in non traditional jobs  women in full time work earn 19  less than men  according to the equal opportunities commission  eoc   the minister told delegates that getting rid of  career sexism  was vital to closing the gender pay gap   career sexism limits opportunities for women of all ages and prevents them from achieving their full potential   it is simply wrong to assume someone cannot do a job on the grounds of their sex   she said  earlier  she told bbc radio 4 s today programme   what we are talking about here is the fact that about six out of 20 women work in jobs that are low paid and typically dominated by women  so we have got very segregated employment   unfortunately  in some cases  this reflects very old fashioned and stereotypical ideas about the appropriate jobs for women  or indeed for men   career sexism is about saying that engineering  for instance  where only 10  of employees are women  is really a male dominated industry  construction is even worse   but it is also about saying childcare jobs are really there for women and not suitable for men  career sexism goes both ways   she added that while progress had been mad,news article

michael howard has finally revealed the full scale of his planned tory tax cuts  should he win the next general election  he has earmarked £4 billion that will be used to reduce taxes   although he still will not say which or how  this was the pre election message many in his party have been pressing for and voters  he believes  will warm to  at its simplest  it is saying   vote tory and you can have it both ways   not only would his government stick to labour spending plans on core public services  including health and education  it would increase spending on defence  police and pensions  and even after that was done  it would still have enough left over for a tax cut equivalent to about a penny off the basic rate of income tax  all the money would come from its £35 billion efficiency savings which would see the axe taken to bureaucracy  waste and the civil service  of that  £23 billion would go on spending plans  with £8 billion to fill the black hole left  they claim  by gordon brown  and the rest going in tax cuts  neither mr howard nor mr letwin would say exactly how they would use that cash  although a cut in the basic rate seems unlikely  ideas already floated include raising tax thresholds and abolishing or reducing inheritance tax  although some in the tory party are urging mr howard to announce something more eye catching before the election  as the tory leader declared  the aim of the exercise is to open up a real economic policy divide between labour and the tories   at this election  people will have a clear choice between mr blair who will waste more and tax more and the conservative party which will give value for money and tax less   he said  it is a move back towards an almost traditional tory message which previously suggested labour was the party of tax rises and the conservatives the party of tax cuts  the extension of that  however  was that labour was also seen as the party of big spending on the public services while the tories were the cutters  and that is where one of the problems lies for mr howard   can he persuade sceptical voters that they really can have it both ways with bigger spending on public services and lower taxes  he insists he will not promise anything before the election that he cannot deliver if put into downing street  labour  ne,news article

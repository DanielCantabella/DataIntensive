a scottish firm is looking to attract web surfers with a search engine that reads out results  called speegle  it has the look and feel of a normal search engine  with the added feature of being able to read out the results  scottish speech technology firm cec systems launched the site in november  but experts have questioned whether talking search engines are of any real benefit to people with visual impairments  the edinburgh based firm cec has married speech technology with ever popular internet search  the ability to search is becoming increasingly crucial to surfers baffled by the huge amount of information available on the web  according to search engine ask jeeves  around 80  of surfers visit search engines as their first port of call on the net  people visiting speegle can select one of three voices to read the results of a query or summarise news stories from sources such as the bbc and reuters   it is still a bit robotic and can make a few mistakes but we are never going to have completely natural sounding voices and it is not bad   said speegle founder gordon renton   the system is ideal for people with blurred vision or for those that just want to search for something in the background while they do something else   we are not saying that it will be suitable for totally blind people  although the royal national institute of the blind  rnib  is looking at the technology   he added  but julie howell  digital policy manager at the rnib  expressed doubts over whether speegle and similar sites added anything to blind people s experience of the web   there are a whole lot of options like this springing up on the web and one has to think carefully about what the market is going to be   she said   blind people have specialised screen readers available to them which will do the job these technologies do in a more sophisticated way   she added  the site uses a technology dubbed panavox  which takes web text and converts it into synthesised speech  in the past speech technology has only been compatible with broadband because of the huge files it downloads but cec says its compression technology means it will also work on slower dial up connections  visitors to speegle may notice that the look and feel of the site bears more than a passing resemblance to the better known,news article

the kyrgyz republic  a small  mountainous state of the former soviet republic  is using invisible ink and ultraviolet readers in the country s elections as part of a drive to prevent multiple voting  this new technology is causing both worries and guarded optimism among different sectors of the population  in an effort to live up to its reputation in the 1990s as  an island of democracy   the kyrgyz president  askar akaev  pushed through the law requiring the use of ink during the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections  the us government agreed to fund all expenses associated with this decision  the kyrgyz republic is seen by many experts as backsliding from the high point it reached in the mid 1990s with a hastily pushed through referendum in 2003  reducing the legislative branch to one chamber with 75 deputies  the use of ink is only one part of a general effort to show commitment towards more open elections   the german embassy  the soros foundation and the kyrgyz government have all contributed to purchase transparent ballot boxes  the actual technology behind the ink is not that complicated  the ink is sprayed on a person s left thumb  it dries and is not visible under normal light  however  the presence of ultraviolet light  of the kind used to verify money  causes the ink to glow with a neon yellow light  at the entrance to each polling station  one election official will scan voter s fingers with uv lamp before allowing them to enter  and every voter will have his her left thumb sprayed with ink before receiving the ballot  if the ink shows under the uv light the voter will not be allowed to enter the polling station  likewise  any voter who refuses to be inked will not receive the ballot  these elections are assuming even greater significance because of two large factors   the upcoming parliamentary elections are a prelude to a potentially regime changing presidential election in the autumn as well as the echo of recent elections in other former soviet republics  notably ukraine and georgia  the use of ink has been controversial   especially among groups perceived to be pro government  widely circulated articles compared the use of ink to the rural practice of marking sheep   a still common metaphor in this primarily agricultural society  the author of,news article

brian moore believes the england captain should not be a full back  jason robinson has led the team during their opening three defeats in the six nations tournament  in the absence of fly half jonny wilkinson  the world champions have struggled since the retirement of former captain martin johnson  a lock forward  and former england captain moore told the bbc   full backs are too far away from the action  that s not a reflection on robinson personally   he added   i just think the point of influence needs to move closer to the pack   which is  after all  where games usually start and finish   moore says a lack of cohesion in the forwards is one of the reasons why england have lost against wales  france and ireland in this year s tournament   assertiveness in the pack isn t there  we re not getting enough people into the breakdowns   he explained   wer e not getting quick ball  which means the backs are being stifled  their creativity depends on quick ball and we re not getting that   with injuries depriving him of key players like wilkinson  coach andy robinson has given youngsters such as harry ellis and jamie noon a chance  and moore believes the last two games against italy and scotland are a good opportunity to experiment further   the problem is the players that are around to replace the icons which have been lost because of retirement and injury don t have the requisite experience   moore added   you can t do anything about that but play them  there are players who have been knocking on the door  it s time for them to be looked at in these last two games because there s nothing on them   we then go into next season with a greater certainty of who can and cannot handle the pressure of international rugby,news article

faster  better or funkier hardware alone is not going to help phone firms sell more handsets  research suggests  instead  phone firms keen to get more out of their customers should not just be pushing the technology for its own sake  consumers are far more interested in how handsets fit in with their lifestyle than they are in screen size  onboard memory or the chip inside  shows an in depth study by handset maker ericsson   historically in the industry there has been too much focus on using technology   said dr michael bjorn  senior advisor on mobile media at ericsson s consumer and enterprise lab   we have to stop saying that these technologies will change their lives   he said   we should try to speak to consumers in their own language and help them see how it fits in with what they are doing   he told the bbc news website  for the study  ericsson interviewed 14 000 mobile phone owners on the ways they use their phone   people s habits remain the same   said dr bjorn   they just move the activity into the mobile phone as it s a much more convenient way to do it   one good example of this was diary writing among younger people  he said  while diaries have always been popular  a mobile phone    especially one equipped with a camera    helps them keep it in a different form  youngsters  use of text messages also reflects their desire to chat and keep in contact with friends and again just lets them do it in a slightly changed way  dr bjorn said that although consumers do what they always did but use a phone to do it  the sheer variety of what the new handset technologies make possible does gradually drive new habits and lifestyles  ericsson s research has shown that consumers divide into different  tribes  that use phones in different ways  dr bjorn said groups dubbed  pioneers  and  materialists  were most interested in trying new things and were behind the start of many trends in phone use   for instance   he said   older people are using sms much more than they did five years ago   this was because younger users  often the children of ageing mobile owners  encouraged older people to try it so they could keep in touch  another factor governing the speed of change in mobile phone use was the simple speed with which new devices are bought by pioneers and materialists  onl,news article

immigration and asylum have normally been issues politicians from the big parties have tiptoed around at election time  but no longer  both labour and the tories have signalled their intention of making them central to their election campaigns  they have been struck by the level of concern amongst voters about the issues  with internal surveys showing they have the potential to swing large numbers of votes  that was also true at the last general election and the issue did briefly become a campaigning issue  but it sparked the probably predictable furore with claims politicians were either stoking up xenophobia or  alternatively  running scared of addressing the problem  but this time around it looks set to be one of the core battlegrounds with both the big parties competing to set out tough policies  the tories are already committed to imposing annual limits on immigration  with a quota for asylum seekers and with applications processed outside the uk  labour has already branded the proposal unworkable but party strategists have seen the tories seizing a poll advantage over the issue  now home secretary charles clarke has come up with alternative proposals for a points system to ensure only immigrants who can benefit the economy will be granted entry  and to kick out more failed asylum seekers  that has been attacked by the tories as too little  too late and for failing to tackle the key issue of the numbers entering the uk  the liberal democrats have not been drawn too deeply into the argument but have called for a europe wide policy on immigration  but  while all the parties appear to agree the time has come to properly debate and address the issue  there are already signs they will run into precisely the same problems as before  former union leader sir bill morris has already accused both the big parties of engaging in a  bidding war about who can be nastiest to asylum seekers    my concern is that  whilst the labour party and the conservative party will take a constructive approach to the debate  right wing political parties  picking up on statements like  burden to britain  will exploit this and create a lot of fear and uncertainty   it is precisely that concern   and the possible suggestion the issue is playing to the far right s racist agenda   that will provoke st,news article

expanded  updated  and more relevant than ever  this bestselling business classic by two internationally renowned management analysts describes a business system for the twenty first century that supersedes the mass production system of ford  the financial control system of sloan  and the strategic system of welch and ge  it is based on the toyota  lean  model  which combines operational excellence with value based strategies to produce steady growth through a wide range of economic conditions  in contrast with the crash and burn performance of companies trumpeted by business gurus in the 1990s  the firms profiled in lean thinking    from tiny lantech to midsized wiremold to niche producer porsche to gigantic pratt   whitney    have kept on keeping on  largely unnoticed  along a steady upward path through the market turbulence and crushed dreams of the early twenty first century  meanwhile  the leader in lean thinking    toyota    has set its sights on leadership of the global motor vehicle industry in this decade  instead of constantly reinventing business models  lean thinkers go back to basics by asking what the customer really perceives as value   it s often not at all what existing organizations and assets would suggest   the next step is to line up value creating activities for a specific product along a value stream while eliminating activities  usually the majority  that don t add value  then the lean thinker creates a flow condition in which the design and the product advance smoothly and rapidly at the pull of the customer  rather than the push of the producer   finally  as flow and pull are implemented  the lean thinker speeds up the cycle of improvement in pursuit of perfection  the first part of this book describes each of these concepts and makes them come alive with striking examples  lean thinking clearly demonstrates that these simple ideas can breathe new life into any company in any industry in any country  but most managers need guidance on how to make the lean leap in their firm  part ii provides a step by step action plan  based on in depth studies of more than fifty lean companies in a wide range of industries across the world  even those readers who believe they have embraced lean thinking will discover in part iii that another dramatic leap is pos,book description

well  it s goodbye to another olympic year and as usual there were plenty of highs and lows in athens  obviously  there s no getting away from the differing fortunes of kelly holmes and paula radcliffe  but i want to remind you of a few more events that made 2004 another year to remember   or forget   for athletics  one of my favourite olympic moments was kelly s success in the 800m  winning that race was the key to her success because if she won that then the 1500m would be a bit of a formality  kelly had been full of  should i  shouldn t i   thoughts about going for the double in athens  i thought why wouldn t you do the 800m  it s your best event  it was such good fun to commentate on her 1500m and it was nice to be able to be part of her athens story  the victory for the british men s 4x100m relay team was a bit of a surprise but a great climax to the games  i think the four of them   jason gardener  darren campbell  marlon devonish and mark lewis francis   knew deep down that it was their best chance of a medal  the lads had run poorly in the individual sprints so maybe they did lift their game when they knew something was really at stake  hicham el guerrouj s olympic double is a much bigger achievement than kelly s on a global scale  he was the first man since for 80 years to win both the 1500m and 5 000m titles  as soon as he had added the 5 000m crown and i had finished commentating  i jumped up  ran down the stairs  pushed everyone out the way and just gave him a big hug  he is one of the few african runners who has embraced the tradition of the mile and he loves to hear all the roger bannister stories  hicham is someone i enjoy having a bit of time with  even though my french and his english are not very good  what happened to paula in athens this year is the obvious low on a personal level and for the expectations of the nation as well  there were a set of circumstances around athens that conspired to produce a very dramatic ending which i think has been greatly misunderstood  dropping out of the marathon was the right thing to do but starting in the 10 000m five days later was not wise  that was her heart and not her head reacting  paula had a lot of little things going wrong in her preparation and on the day  things like niggling injuries  not being able to d,news article

john drury s clear  marvelously erudite  and richly detailed introduction to the everyman s library edition of the new testament reminds us why the king james version  first published in 1611  has been the favorite of english readers for centuries  despite a plethora of new translations in the second half of the twentieth century  the king james version retains its power and appeal because  it has the intrinsic value of a classic and is an enduring masterpiece  drury outlines the fascinating history of this magisterial translation  marveling at the  patient generosity  with which the translators sifted through and distilled a century of previous scholarship  he points out that their work has endured not only because of the astonishing care they took to reflect faithfully the syntax of the original hebrew and greek–which enabled them to dispense with the densely entangled prose style that characterized english writing at the time–but also because of their concern to writers from milton to coleridge to george eliot  from the doctrinal richness of the letters of st  paul to those four masterpieces of storytelling  the gospels  the new testament has served as a source of inspiration for centuries to quote george steiner on the centrality of the bible   what you have in hand is not a book  it is the book  that  of course  is what  bible  means  it is the book which  not only in western humanity  defines the concept of a text  all our other books  however different in matter or method  relate  be it indirectly  to this book of books…all other books are inhabited by the murmur of that distant source,book description

a team of us researchers has shown that controlling devices with the brain is a step closer  four people  two of them partly paralysed wheelchair users  successfully moved a computer cursor while wearing a cap with 64 electrodes  previous research has shown that monkeys can control a computer with electrodes implanted into their brain  the new york team reported their findings in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences   the results show that people can learn to use scalp recorded electroencephalogram rhythms to control rapid and accurate movement of a cursor in two directions   said jonathan wolpaw and dennis mcfarlane  the research team  from new york state department of health and state university of new york in albany  said the research was another step towards people controlling wheelchairs or other electronic devices by thought  the four people faced a large video screen wearing a special cap which  meant no surgery or implantation was needed  brain activity produces electrical signals that can be read by electrodes  complex algorithms then translate those signals into instructions to direct the computer  such brain activity does not require the use of any nerves of muscles  so people with stroke or spinal cord injuries could use the cap effectively   the impressive non invasive multidimensional control achieved in the present study suggests that a non invasive brain control interface could support clinically useful operation of a robotic arm  a motorised wheelchair or a neuroprosthesis   said the researchers  the four volunteers also showed that they could get better at controlling the cursor the more times they tried  although the two partially paralysed people performed better overall  the researchers said this could be because their brains were more used to adapting or that they were simply more motivated  it is not the first time researchers have had this sort of success in brain control experiments  some teams have used eye motion and other recording techniques  earlier this year  a team at the mit media labs europe demonstrated a wireless cap which read brain waves to control a computer character,news article

chancellor gordon brown has been given a £2 1bn boost in his attempts to meet his golden economic rule  which allows him to borrow only for investment  the extra leeway came after the office for national statistics said it had been measuring road expenditure data wrongly over the past five years  it comes just weeks ahead of the budget and an expected general election  shadow chancellor oliver letwin said   at best the timing of these changes is very convenient for the government   a review by the ons found it had made a mistake by  double counting  some spending on roads since 1998 9  correcting the error would mean reducing current expenditure and increasing net investment  thus helping mr brown to meet his  golden rule  of borrowing only to invest over the economic cycle  economists speculated that it might also allow for some vote catching measures in the budget  the changes by the ons increase the current budget measure for the past five years by £2 1bn in total  mr letwin said   this is a very murky area    there will inevitably be suspicions that the figures are being fiddled   the conservatives also said mr brown would still be forced to raise taxes after the general election to fill an annual £10 5bn  black hole  in the nation s coffers  but the treasury said there would be no relaxation of economic discipline and the golden rule would be met even without the data revisions  in january the independent institute for fiscal studies  ifs  said mr brown would need to raise taxes to get public finances onto the track predicted in last year s budget  it also said the government might narrowly miss its  golden rule  if the current economic cycle ended in 2005 06  after the ons announcement  economists said there could also be a proportionate boost to the current budget in 2004 05 of about £400m   none of this changes the big picture of a dramatic deterioration in the overall fiscal position over the last four or five years   said jonathan loynes  chief uk economist at capital economics   accordingly  it seems very likely that some form of fiscal consolidation will be required in due course,news article

teenagers from well off backgrounds are six times more likely to go to university than those from the most deprived areas  a report says  the higher education funding council for england said more people went to university between 1994 and 2000  but the percentage of poorer students  hardly changed at all   said its chief executive  sir howard newby  increasingly more women than men went to university  while tuition fees and student loans made no major difference  the hefce report  drawing on child benefits data  said teenagers in the richest areas could expect a better than 50  chance of going to university  while in the poorest neighbourhoods it was 10   participation at constituency level ranged from 69  in kensington and chelsea  65  in the city of london and westminster and 62  in sheffield hallam  down to 10  in bristol south and leeds central and 8  in nottingham north and sheffield brightside  sir howard said the report highlighted the  entrenched divisions  between rich and poor areas  but added it was a social as much as an educational problem  he told bbc news   we know  once children from deprived backgrounds get into university  they do very well  in fact surprisingly more go into postgraduate study than those from more affluent backgrounds   the issue is  i think  one of raising aspirations amongst those families and those communities that university is something for them and not for other people   he said by the time universities traditionally dealt with pupils  between the ages of 16 and 18  it was too late  instead they should be reaching out to communities and schools much earlier  even down to primary school level  to persuade them a university education was something they could aspire to  he said  but while the report revealed stark inequalities and exposed the extent of the challenge  there were some encouraging findings  he added  tuition fees and student loans in england and wales   and the different fee regime in scotland   did not seem to have affected the choices of young people  even the poorest  the report also showed women were 18  more likely than men to enter higher education in 2000   up from 6  in 1994  in the poorest areas  the gap was 30  in women s favour and growing faster than anywhere else  the higher education minister  kim howells,news article

other things being equal  the notion of entrepreneurs languishing in jail while their companies are sold off for a song ought to be bad for business  but in the looking glass world of modern russia  the opposite might just be true  a new report  has argued  the study  from the centre for economic policy research  does not praise the rough handling of oil company yukos  but it argues that more rigorous tax policing has benefited all russian firms  even targets of the tax police   an increase in tax enforcement can increase the amount  of dividends and other income  outside shareholders will receive  even accounting for increased levels of taxation   the authors say  the paper s reasoning is complex  and is based on a sophisticated model of the relationship between tax regimes and corporate governance   in particular  the propensity of management to steal from the company  the calculations demonstrated what many russian analysts already knew  that increasing the tax rate increases the amount that managers steal  since undeclared income becomes relatively more valuable  in the west  meanwhile  higher tax rates translate far more smoothly into higher government revenues  on the other hand  increasing the rigour with which taxes are collected encourages companies to become more transparent  forcing them to be able to demonstrate their financial position far more accurately  the net result  the authors say  is that the extra amount companies pay in tax is more than compensated for by greater efficiency and financial soundness  after vladimir putin became president in 2000  he did not raise taxes  but put a lot of effort   too much  critics argue   into enforcement  since then  the russian stock market has more than trebled in value  a rise the authors attribute at least in part to the newly tough approach  the report highlights the case of sibneft  a russian oil company that came close to merging with yukos last year  after mr putin came to power  the company s overall effective tax rate rose from 2 6  to 10 4   and sibneft was the target of a series of aggressive raids by fiscal police  but shareholders benefited hugely  sibneft started to pay dividends    53m in 2000 and almost  1bn in 2001   and closed down the network of opaque subsidiaries it had previously used for siphon,news article

a proposed european law on software patents will not be re drafted by the european commission  ec  despite requests by meps  the law is proving controversial and has been in limbo for a year  some major tech firms say it is needed to protect inventions  while others fear it will hurt smaller tech firms  the ec says the council of ministers will adopt a draft version that was agreed upon last may but said it would review  all aspects of the directive   the directive is intended to offer patent protection to inventions that use software to achieve their effect  in other words   computer implemented invention   in a letter  ec president jos  233  manuel barroso told the president of the european parliament  josep borrell  that the commission  did not intend to refer a new proposal to the parliament and the council  of ministers   as it had supported the agreement reached by ministers in may 2004  if the european council agrees on the draft directive it will then return for a second reading at the european parliament  but that will not guarantee that the directive will become law   instead it will probably mean further delays and controversy over the directive  most eu legislation now needs the approval of both parliament and the council of ministers before it becomes law  french green mep alain lipietz warned two weeks ago that if the commission ignored the parliament s request it would be an  insult  to the assembly  he said that the parliament would then reject the council s version of the legislation as part of the final or conciliation stage of the decision procedure  in the us  the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted  this means that the us based amazon com holds a patent for its  one click shopping  service  for example  critics are concerned that the directive could lead to a similar model happening in europe  this  they fear  could hurt small software developers because they do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies if they had to fight patent legal action in court  supporters say current laws are inefficient and it would serve to even up a playing field without bringing eu laws in line with the us,news article

the arrival of new titles in the popular medal of honor and call of duty franchises leaves fans of wartime battle titles spoilt for choice  the acclaimed pc title call of duty has been updated for console formats  building on many of the original s elements  for its part  the long running medal of honor series has added pacific assault to its pc catalogue  adapting the console game rising sun  call of duty  finest hour casts you as a succession of allied soldiers fighting on world war 2 battlefronts including russia and north africa  it is a traditional first person viewed game that lets you control just one character  in the midst of a unit where cohorts constantly bark orders at you  on a near identical note  medal of honor  pacific assault does all it can to make you feel part of a tight knit team and plum in the middle of all out action  its arenas are the war s pacific battles  including guadalcanal and pearl harbour  you play one character throughout  a raw and rather talkative us soldier  both games rely on a carefully stage managed structure that keeps things ticking along  when this works  it is a brilliant device to make you feel part of a story  when it does not  it is tedious  a winning moment is an early scene in pacific assault  where you come under attack at the famous us base in hawaii  you are first ushered into a gunboat attacking the incoming waves of japanese planes  then made to descend into a sinking battleship to rescue crewman  before seizing the anti aircraft guns  it is one of the finest set pieces ever seen in a video game  this notion of shuffling the player along a studiously pre determined path  forcibly witnessing a series of pre set moments of action  is a perilous business which can make the whole affair feel stilted rather than organic  the genius of something like half life 2 is that it skilfully disguises its linear plotting by various means of misdirection  this pair of games do not really accomplish that  being more concerned with imparting a full on atmospheric experience  call of duty comes with a suitably bombastic score and overblown presentation  finest hour has a similar determination  framing everything in moody wartime music  archive footage and lots of reflective voice overs  letting you play a number of different roles is an,news article

if you don t know art but know what you like  new search technology could prove a useful gateway to painting  artgarden  developed by bt s research unit  is being tested by the tate as a new way of browsing its online collection of paintings  rather than search by the name of an artist or painting  users are shown a selection of pictures  clicking on their favourite will change the gallery in front of them to a selection of similar works  the technology uses a system dubbed smart serendipity  which is a combination of artificial intelligence and random selection  it  chooses  a selection of pictures  by scoring paintings based on a selection of keywords associated with them  so  for instance a whistler painting of a bridge may have the obvious keywords such as bridge and whistler associated to it but will also widen the search net with terms such as aesthetic movement  19th century and water  a variety of paintings will then be shown to the user  based partly on the keywords and partly on luck   it is much more akin to wandering through the gallery   said jemima rellie  head of the tate s digital programme  for richard tateson  who worked on the artgarden project  the need for a new way to search grew out of personal frustration   i went to an online clothes store to find something to buy my wife for christmas but i didn t have a clue what i wanted   he said  the text based search was restricted to looking either by type of garment or designer  neither of which he found helpful  he ended up doing his present shopping on the high street instead  he thinks the dominance of text based searching is not necessarily appealing to the majority of online shoppers  similarly  with art  browsing is often more important than finding a particular object   you don t arrive at tate britain and tell people what you want to see  one of the skills of showing off the collection is to introduce people to things they wouldn t have asked for   he said  the tate is committed to making its art more accessible and technology such as artgarden can help with that  said ms rellie  she hopes the technology can be incorporated on to the website in the near future  bt research is looking at extending the technology to other searching  such as for music and films,news article

plans to give murderers lighter sentences if they plead guilty have been watered down  there was an outcry three months ago when the sentencing guidelines council   led by lord woolf   published its proposals for england and wales  it had suggested judges should reduce sentences by a third for murderers who confessed at the earliest opportunity  but that has now been changed to one sixth  with no reduction for those killers given a  whole life tariff   at the time lord woolf  the lord chief justice  had said the one third reduction would only be in extraordinary circumstances   for example  if people gave themselves up before their crime had even been detected  the guidelines were to recognise the need to spare victims and witnesses the trauma of going to court where possible  by allowing lighter sentences for guilty pleas and co operation  he said  but director of the victims of crime trust  norman brennan  accused lord woolf of having an  arrogant contempt for victims of crime and the law abiding public   the national association of probation officers said the move would be  political suicide   in revised proposals from the sentencing guidelines council  sgc   the section on murder said possible reductions would have to be  weighed carefully  by a judge so they did not lead to  an inappropriately short sentence   where it was appropriate to reduce the minimum term having regard to a plea of guilty  the maximum reduction would be one sixth  and should never exceed five years  it said  in a statement issued on wednesday lord woolf said   i have no doubt that being able to call on the diverse backgrounds and experiences of all those that serve on the sgc has vastly improved the final guidelines   i am confident  as a result  that judges will be better placed to deliver sentences which are effective both as punishments and deterrents to offending and reoffending   director of public prosecutions  ken macdonald qc  who sits on the sgc  said the principle of discounting sentences to offenders for early guilty pleas is set down by parliament   what the new guideline on reduced sentences for guilty pleas does is increase the chances of convicting the guilty by bringing clarity to this process   it represents a tougher regime than existed previously  because the discount is auto,news article

a system to make it easier to create website addresses using alphabets like cyrillic could open a back door for scammers  a trade body has warned  the internationalised domain names system has been a work in progress for years and has recently been approved by the internet engineering task force  but the uk internet forum  ukif  is concerned that the system will let scammers create fake sites more easily  the problem lies in the computer codes used to represent language  registering names that look like that of legitimate companies but lead users to fake sites designed to steal passwords and credit card details could become a whole lot easier for determined scammers  says stephen dyer  director of ukif  domain names are the  real language  addresses of websites  rather than their internet protocol address  which is a series of numbers  they are used so people can more easily navigate the web  so called ascii codes are used to represent european languages but for other languages a hybrid of a system called unicode is used  so  for example  website paypal could now be coded using a mixture of the latin alphabet and the russian alphabet  the resulting domain as displayed to the users would look identical to the real site as a russian  a  look just like an english  a   but the computer code would be different  and the site it would lead users to could be a fake  this is more than just a theory  a fake paypal com has already been registered with net domain giant verisign by someone who has followed the debate around the internationalised domain name  idn  system  said mr dyer  as the idea was to prove a point rather than be malicious the fake domain has now been handed back to paypal but it sets a worrying precedent  mr dyer said   although the idn problem is well known in technical circles  the commercial world is totally unaware how easily their websites can be faked   said mr dyer   it is important to alert users that there is a new and invisible and almost undetectable way of diverting them to what looks like a perfectly genuine site   he added  there are solutions  for instance  browsers could spot domains that use mixed characters and display them in different colours as a warning to users  mr dyer acknowledged that it would be a huge undertaking to update all the world,news article

one of the world s largest manufacturers of hiv aids drugs has launched an initiative to combat the smuggling of cheaper pills   supplied to poorer african countries   back into europe for resale at far higher price  the company  glaxosmithkline  is to alter the packaging and change the colour of the pills  currently provided to developing nations under a humanitarian agreement  it is estimated that drugs companies are losing hundreds of millions of dollars each year as a result of the diversion of their products in this way  this is a very sensitive area for the big drugs companies  they want to maintain their profits  but have been put under tremendous pressure to provide cheap anti aids drugs to the world s poorest nations  the result is that drugs supplied to africa are now more than thirty times cheaper than those sold in europe  bringing these medicines within the reach of millions of hiv positive africans through their government s health care systems  but the wide difference in price also means that there are big gains to be made from illegally diverting these cheaper drugs back into wealthier countries and re selling them at a higher price  glaxosmithkline believes that by coating the pills destined for africa in a red dye and adding new identification codes both onto the pills and on the packaging  then this trade can be substantially reduced  the company says that it will then be possible to identify specific distributors in africa who have re sold humanitarian drugs for profit  as well as those suppliers in europe that have also been involved in the trade  glaxo says distribution of the new look drugs has already begun and that their chemical content is identical to those currently being sold in europe,news article

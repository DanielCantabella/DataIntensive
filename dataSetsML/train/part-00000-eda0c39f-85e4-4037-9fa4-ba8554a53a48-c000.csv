a blind student has developed software that turns colours into musical notes so that he can read weather maps  victor wong  a graduate student from hong kong studying at cornell university in new york state  had to read coloured maps of the upper atmosphere as part of his research  to study  space weather  mr wong needed to explore minute fluctuations in order to create mathematical models  a number of solutions were tried  including having a colleague describe the maps and attempting to print them in braille  mr wong eventually hit upon the idea of translating individual colours into music  and enlisted the help of a computer graphics specialist and another student to do the programming work   the images have three dimensions and i had to find a way of reading them myself   mr wong told the bbc news website   for the sake of my own study   and for the sake of blind scientists generally   i felt it would be good to develop software that could help us to read colour images   he tried a prototype version of the software to explore a photograph of a parrot  in order to have an exact reference to the screen  a pen and tablet device is used  the software then assigns one of 88 piano notes to individually coloured pixels   ranging from blue at the lower end of this scale to red at the upper end  mr wong says the application is still very much in its infancy and is only useful for reading images that have been created digitally   if i took a random picture and scanned it and then used my software to recognise it  it wouldn t work that well   mr wong has been blind from the age of seven and he thinks that having a  colour memory  makes the software more useful than it would be to a scientist who had never had any vision   as the notes increase in pitch i know the colour s getting redder and redder  and in my mind s eye a patch of red appears   the colour to music software has not yet been made available commercially  and mr wong believes that several people would have to work together to make it viable  but he hopes that one day it can be developed to give blind people access to photographs and other images,news article

a proposed european law on software patents will not be re drafted by the european commission  ec  despite requests by meps  the law is proving controversial and has been in limbo for a year  some major tech firms say it is needed to protect inventions  while others fear it will hurt smaller tech firms the ec says the council of ministers will adopt a draft version that was agreed upon last may but said it would review  all aspects of the directive   the directive is intended to offer patent protection to inventions that use software to achieve their effect  in other words   computer implemented invention   in a letter  ec president jos  233  manuel barroso told the president of the european parliament  josep borrell  that the commission  did not intend to refer a new proposal to the parliament and the council  of ministers   as it had supported the agreement reached by ministers in may 2004  if the european council agrees on the draft directive it will then return for a second reading at the european parliament  but that will not guarantee that the directive will become law   instead it will probably mean further delays and controversy over the directive  most eu legislation now needs the approval of both parliament and the council of ministers before it becomes law  french green mep alain lipietz warned two weeks ago that if the commission ignored the parliament s request it would be an  insult  to the assembly  he said that the parliament would then reject the council s version of the legislation as part of the final or conciliation stage of the decision procedure  in the us  the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted  this means that the us based amazon com holds a patent for its  one click shopping  service  for example  critics are concerned that the directive could lead to a similar model happening in europe  this  they fear  could hurt small software developers because they do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies if they had to fight patent legal action in court  supporters say current laws are inefficient and it would serve to even up a playing field without bringing eu laws in line with the us,news article

the economic targets set out at the lisbon summit of european union leaders in 2000 were meant to help europe leapfrog its way past the united states to become the world s leading economy by 2010  but the lisbon targets are about much more than just economic prestige  for many economists and analysts they are about ensuring europe doesn t become a global economic laggard  they are also about ensuring europe can continue to compete as an equal with the growing economic giants of asia  india and china  as well as with the economic might of the united states  that s why there was a tone of urgency in the report  out on wednesday  by the former dutch prime minister wim kok  mr kok was commissioned by the european commission in march this year to assess how far the eu has come towards meeting the lisbon targets  five years on from their inception  his conclusion was simple  too many of the targets will be seriously missed  lisbon risks becoming a  synonym for missed objectives and failed promises   his report said   the status quo is not an option   at risk in the medium to long run is nothing less than the sustainability of the society europe has built  it said  the report comes at a time when europe s competitive position is waning  the eu s economic growth rate is projected to be 2  this year and 2 4  next  while there has been growth in overall employment rates in europe  productivity lags behind that of the us  but meeting the lisbon targets requires a political commitment that no eu member state has volunteered so far  that has in part been due to the state of the global economy in the past few years  as mr kok s report noted   the ink had scarcely dried on the  lisbon  agreement before the worldwide stock market bubble imploded    the us suffered two years of economic slowdown and recession and the european economy followed suit   the circumstances weren t conducive to creating the 20 million new jobs promised by eu leaders in lisbon in 2000  neither were they conducive to getting governments to spend more on research and development  money needed if the eu was to meet its target of becoming a so called  knowledge based economy    the  lisbon  vision is a compelling one  but in order,news article

that s what i call a tough game  it was very physical and fair play to the italians they made us work very hard for our victory  their organisation was very  very good and they proved again that they are getting better and better as the years go by  it is by far the strongest italian team that we have faced  we knew all along that we would be a huge threat particularly the first game in the championship  it was not like the days gone by when you could get scores on the board early  we had to work our socks off and try and build our scores gradually  it was really hard work out there and the players have plenty of bumps and bruises to prove it  i m not too bad  but there are one or two others who will be feeling it a bit on monday morning  in the backs  we were not frustrated at such  but the new rucking laws were a little bit problematical  the different interpretations between the referee and the players was a little difficult  but we managed to get the ball in our hands and i got a try near the end of the first half  it s always good to score  it was great work by brian and i always knew i had scored even though it went upstairs to the video referee  eddie  o sullivan  was very calm at half time even though we were only 8 6 ahead  he spelled out what we needed to do and advocated getting the ball out of our own territory  that new ruck law made it a bit more difficult to get out of our own half  we were penalised a lot at the breakdown  and if they had kicked all their chances at goal we would have been behind at the break  so really we went back to playing a territory game and simplifying things and having more patience on the ball  every one was a little down after the game following the injuries to brian and gordon  as yet we do not know the full extent of the injuries  but it does not that good  now we have to focus on scotland and only six days to recover  it s a big ask after such a bruising encounter  i was very impressed the way the scots played against the french on saturday  it could so easily have gone their way but for a couple of decisions  we will be under no illusions it is going to be tough for us  in the meantime  when in rome,news article

fidel castro s decision to ban all cash transactions in us dollars in cuba has once more turned the spotlight on cuba s ailing economy  all conversions between the us dollar and cuba s  convertible  peso will from 8 november be subject to a 10  tax  cuban citizens  who receive money from overseas  and foreign visitors  who change dollars in cuba  will be affected  critics of the measure argue that it is a step backwards  reflecting the cuban president s desire to increase his control of the economy and to clamp down on private enterprise  in a live television broadcast announcing the measure  president castro s chief aide said it was necessary because of the united states  increasing  economic aggression    the ten percent obligation applies exclusively to the dollar by virtue of the situation created by the new measures of the us government to suffocate our country   he said  the bush administration has taken an increasingly harsh line on cuba in recent months  president bush s government  which has been a strong supporter of the 40 year old trade embargo on cuba  introduced even tighter restrictions on cuba in may  cubans living in the us are now limited to one visit to cuba every three years and they can only send money to their immediate relatives  a leading expert on the cuban economy says that castro s tax plan smacks more of a desperate economic measure than a political gesture   i think it is primarily an effort to raise some cash   says jose barrionuevo  head of strategy for latin american emerging markets for barclays capital   it underscores the fact that the economy is in very bad shape and the government is looking for sources of revenue   the tax will hit the families of cuban exiles hardest as they benefit from the money their displaced relatives send home  this money  known as remittances  can amount to as much as  1bn a year  those remaining in cuba will have to pay the tax  their relatives abroad may choose to send money in other currencies which are not subject to the tax  such as euros  or increase their dollar payments to compensate  however  many of cuban s poorest citizens could be worse off as a result  the tax will also affect the two million tourists who visit,news article

chancellor gordon brown has been given a £2 1bn boost in his attempts to meet his golden economic rule  which allows him to borrow only for investment  the extra leeway came after the office for national statistics said it had been measuring road expenditure data wrongly over the past five years  it comes just weeks ahead of the budget and an expected general election  shadow chancellor oliver letwin said   at best the timing of these changes is very convenient for the government   a review by the ons found it had made a mistake by  double counting  some spending on roads since 1998 9  correcting the error would mean reducing current expenditure and increasing net investment  thus helping mr brown to meet his  golden rule  of borrowing only to invest over the economic cycle  economists speculated that it might also allow for some vote catching measures in the budget  the changes by the ons increase the current budget measure for the past five years by £2 1bn in total  mr letwin said   this is a very murky area    there will inevitably be suspicions that the figures are being fiddled   the conservatives also said mr brown would still be forced to raise taxes after the general election to fill an annual £10 5bn  black hole  in the nation s coffers  but the treasury said there would be no relaxation of economic discipline and the golden rule would be met even without the data revisions  in january the independent institute for fiscal studies  ifs  said mr brown would need to raise taxes to get public finances onto the track predicted in last year s budget  it also said the government might narrowly miss its  golden rule  if the current economic cycle ended in 2005 06  after the ons announcement  economists said there could also be a proportionate boost to the current budget in 2004 05 of about £400m   none of this changes the big picture of a dramatic deterioration in the overall fiscal position over the last four or five years   said jonathan loynes  chief uk economist at capital economics   accordingly  it seems very likely that some form of fiscal consolidation will be required in due course,news article

one of the world s largest manufacturers of hiv aids drugs has launched an initiative to combat the smuggling of cheaper pills   supplied to poorer african countries   back into europe for resale at far higher price  the company  glaxosmithkline  is to alter the packaging and change the colour of the pills  currently provided to developing nations under a humanitarian agreement  it is estimated that drugs companies are losing hundreds of millions of dollars each year as a result of the diversion of their products in this way  this is a very sensitive area for the big drugs companies  they want to maintain their profits  but have been put under tremendous pressure to provide cheap anti aids drugs to the world s poorest nations  the result is that drugs supplied to africa are now more than thirty times cheaper than those sold in europe  bringing these medicines within the reach of millions of hiv positive africans through their government s health care systems  but the wide difference in price also means that there are big gains to be made from illegally diverting these cheaper drugs back into wealthier countries and re selling them at a higher price  glaxosmithkline believes that by coating the pills destined for africa in a red dye and adding new identification codes both onto the pills and on the packaging  then this trade can be substantially reduced  the company says that it will then be possible to identify specific distributors in africa who have re sold humanitarian drugs for profit  as well as those suppliers in europe that have also been involved in the trade  glaxo says distribution of the new look drugs has already begun and that their chemical content is identical to those currently being sold in europe,news article

at the mbita point primary school in western kenya students click away at a handheld computer with a stylus  they are doing exercises in their school textbooks which have been digitised  it is a pilot project run by eduvision  which is looking at ways to use low cost computer systems to get up to date information to students who are currently stuck with ancient textbooks  matthew herren from eduvision told the bbc programme go digital how the non governmental organisation uses a combination of satellite radio and handheld computers called e slates   the e slates connect via a wireless connection to a base station in the school  this in turn is connected to a satellite radio receiver  the data is transmitted alongside audio signals   the base station processes the information from the satellite transmission and turns it into a form that can be read by the handheld e slates   it downloads from the satellite and every day processes the stream  sorts through content for the material destined for the users connected to it  it also stores this on its hard disc   the system is cheaper than installing and maintaining an internet connection and conventional computer network  but mr herren says there are both pros and cons to the project   it s very simple to set up  just a satellite antenna on the roof of the school  but it s also a one way connection  so getting feedback or specific requests from end users is difficult   the project is still at the pilot stage and eduvision staff are on the ground to attend to teething problems with the linux based system   the content is divided into visual information  textual information and questions  users can scroll through these sections independently of each other   eduvision is planning to include audio and video files as the system develops and add more content  mr herren says this would vastly increase the opportunities available to the students  he is currently in negotiations to take advantage of a project being organised by search site google to digitise some of the world s largest university libraries   all books in the public domain  something like 15 million  could be put on the base stations as we manufacture them  then every rural school in a,news article

christopher r  browning’s shocking account of how a unit of average middle aged germans became the cold blooded murderers of tens of thousands of jews—now with a new afterword and additional photographs  ordinary men is the true story of reserve police battalion 101 of the german order police  which was responsible for mass shootings as well as round ups of jewish people for deportation to nazi death camps in poland in 1942  browning argues that most of the men of rpb 101 were not fanatical nazis but  rather  ordinary middle aged  working class men who committed these atrocities out of a mixture of motives  including the group dynamics of conformity  deference to authority  role adaptation  and the altering of moral norms to justify their actions  very quickly three groups emerged within the battalion  a core of eager killers  a plurality who carried out their duties reliably but without initiative  and a small minority who evaded participation in the acts of killing without diminishing the murderous efficiency of the battalion whatsoever while this book discusses a specific reserve unit during wwii  the general argument browning makes is that most people succumb to the pressures of a group setting and commit actions they would never do of their own volition   ordinary men is a powerful  chilling  and important work  with themes and arguments that continue to resonate today   ,book description

former blackburn boss roy hodgson says the premiership should follow the rest of europe and have a winter break   but insists that a gruelling domestic schedule will not damage the english elite s bid for champions league glory  hodgson   now in charge at viking stavanger   was at liverpool s clash with bayer leverkusen at anfield on tuesday as a member of uefa s technical committee  hodgson is a fierce advocate of the winter break employed throughout europe  although not in england   where the champions league contenders have ploughed through a heavy fixture list  but hodgson told bbc sport that while he believes the premiership should embrace the idea  he does not expect it to cost the english representatives in the last 16 of the champions league   i just feel it is very difficult to say with certainty that teams who have had the break will have a definite edge   i am a fervent supporter of the break  it gives players the chance to recharge their batteries midway through the season  which some suggest will give teams an advantage in the champions league   the other school of thought suggests having a break then coming back to it puts you at a disadvantage   the bigger discussions around the winter break should be to do with the nature of football today  the needs of football players and the way the premiership has developed  rather than one or two matches in the champions league in february   hodgson believes a winter break carries many advantages  explaining   as i said  it is the perfect chance to recharge batteries   and certainly if i was still a manager in england i would be supporting any calls for its introduction   in pre season you get a lot of enthusiasm and energy but by the time you get towards christmas many players  having also played plenty of international matches for club and country and travelled a lot  find themselves getting very jaded   the break gives them a chance to recover that energy and enthusiasm and  perhaps more importantly  recover their mental strength during the break and get ready for the games ahead   the mental side is by far the most important thing   hodgson added   the length of breaks can vary  in italy the break was very short  you just took c,news article

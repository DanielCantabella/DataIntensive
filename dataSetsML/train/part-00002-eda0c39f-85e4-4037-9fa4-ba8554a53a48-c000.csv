they may not know quite how to describe their position in british politics   the real opposition  the valid opposition  the effective opposition or the authentic opposition  but the liberal democrats are entering the expected 2005 election campaign determined to prove it is they  not the tories  who are now the real threat to labour  as tory leader michael howard kicked off his election campaign  the lib dem leader charles kennedy dismissed the conservatives as a  fading  force  and he insisted there was  no limit  to his party s ambitions in the coming poll  and he can produce some pretty impressive recent election results to back up his optimism for an election which he believes might just see his party doing big things  sensible third party leaders are usually cautious about making any predictions about how they will do come the big test  and mr kennedy was not falling into that trap when he fired up his campaign from the party s westminster hq  he would make no predictions other than that he expected the lib dems to increase both their votes and their commons seats at the election  the gap between labour and the tories was now so narrow   as proved  he claimed  by the defection to labour of robert jackson   that only his party offered a genuine alternative  on the war on iraq  identity cards  student fees and the council tax  there was nothing to chose between the two big parties whereas the liberal democrats offered costed  sensible alternatives  he was also happy to break the two party consensus on taxation by promising to increase income tax on those earning more than £100 000 a year to pay for the scrapping of student fees  the introduction of free personal care for the elderly and replacing the council tax with a local income tax  he was also happy to offer a pledge that he would be doing no deals to  prop up  either of the other big parties after the election  there was a time when such optimistic sounds coming from the third party could be dismissed as self delusion  that is no longer the case with the liberal democrats  the other parties will still insist that the lib dems are no hopers whose greatest effect on the poll will be to boost the hopes of their opponents by denyin,news article

plans to give murderers lighter sentences if they plead guilty have been watered down  there was an outcry three months ago when the sentencing guidelines council   led by lord woolf   published its proposals for england and wales  it had suggested judges should reduce sentences by a third for murderers who confessed at the earliest opportunity  but that has now been changed to one sixth  with no reduction for those killers given a  whole life tariff   at the time lord woolf  the lord chief justice  had said the one third reduction would only be in extraordinary circumstances   for example  if people gave themselves up before their crime had even been detected  the guidelines were to recognise the need to spare victims and witnesses the trauma of going to court where possible  by allowing lighter sentences for guilty pleas and co operation  he said  but director of the victims of crime trust  norman brennan  accused lord woolf of having an  arrogant contempt for victims of crime and the law abiding public   the national association of probation officers said the move would be  political suicide   in revised proposals from the sentencing guidelines council  sgc   the section on murder said possible reductions would have to be  weighed carefully  by a judge so they did not lead to  an inappropriately short sentence   where it was appropriate to reduce the minimum term having regard to a plea of guilty  the maximum reduction would be one sixth  and should never exceed five years  it said  in a statement issued on wednesday lord woolf said   i have no doubt that being able to call on the diverse backgrounds and experiences of all those that serve on the sgc has vastly improved the final guidelines   i am confident  as a result  that judges will be better placed to deliver sentences which are effective both as punishments and deterrents to offending and reoffending   director of public prosecutions  ken macdonald qc  who sits on the sgc  said the principle of discounting sentences to offenders for early guilty pleas is set down by parliament   what the new guideline on reduced sentences for guilty pleas does is increase the chances of convicting the guilty by bringing clarity to this process,news article

well  it s goodbye to another olympic year and as usual there were plenty of highs and lows in athens  obviously  there s no getting away from the differing fortunes of kelly holmes and paula radcliffe  but i want to remind you of a few more events that made 2004 another year to remember   or forget   for athletics  one of my favourite olympic moments was kelly s success in the 800m  winning that race was the key to her success because if she won that then the 1500m would be a bit of a formality  kelly had been full of  should i  shouldn t i   thoughts about going for the double in athens  i thought why wouldn t you do the 800m  it s your best event  it was such good fun to commentate on her 1500m and it was nice to be able to be part of her athens story  the victory for the british men s 4x100m relay team was a bit of a surprise but a great climax to the games  i think the four of them   jason gardener  darren campbell  marlon devonish and mark lewis francis   knew deep down that it was their best chance of a medal  the lads had run poorly in the individual sprints so maybe they did lift their game when they knew something was really at stake  hicham el guerrouj s olympic double is a much bigger achievement than kelly s on a global scale  he was the first man since for 80 years to win both the 1500m and 5 000m titles  as soon as he had added the 5 000m crown and i had finished commentating  i jumped up  ran down the stairs  pushed everyone out the way and just gave him a big hug  he is one of the few african runners who has embraced the tradition of the mile and he loves to hear all the roger bannister stories  hicham is someone i enjoy having a bit of time with  even though my french and his english are not very good  what happened to paula in athens this year is the obvious low on a personal level and for the expectations of the nation as well  there were a set of circumstances around athens that conspired to produce a very dramatic ending which i think has been greatly misunderstood  dropping out of the marathon was the right thing to do but starting in the 10 000m five days later was not wise  that was her heart and not her head reacting  paula had a lot of little things going wron,news article

a major government department is without e mail for a week  and technology analyst bill thompson wants to know what happened  a couple of weeks ago i wrote about how my girlfriend had suffered when her cable modem blew up and she was offline for several days  it seems that thousands of civil servants at the uk s department of work and pensions went through the same thing last week  it has emerged that the internal network crashed in a particularly horrible way  depriving staff of e mail and access to the application software they use to calculate people s benefit and pension entitlement or note changes in personal circumstances  senior consultants from eds  the computer firm which manage the system  and microsoft  which supplied the software  were running around trying to figure out what had to be done to fix it all  while staff resorted to phone  fax and probably carrier pigeon to get work done  fortunately the back office systems which actually pay people their money were still working  so only new claims and updates were affected done properly  this is bad enough for those affected  but it does mean that the impact is not devastating for millions of pensioners  i am sure regular readers will be expecting one of my usual diatribes against poor software  badly specified systems and inadequate disaster recovery plans  although the full story has not yet been told  it seems that the problem started when a plan to upgrade some of the computers from windows 2000 to windows xp went wrong  and xp code was inadvertently copied to thousands of machines across the network  this is certainly unfortunate  but i have a lot of sympathy for the network managers and technology staff involved  today s computer networks are large  complex and occasionally fragile  the interconnectedness that we all value also gives us a degree of instability and unpredictability that we cannot design out of the systems  it is the network equivalent of godel s theorem   any system sufficiently complex to be useful is also able to collapse catastrophically  so i will reserve judgment on the technology aspects until we all know what actually happened and whether it was a consequence of software failure or just bad luck  w,news article

it is unlikely that future technological inventions are going to have the same kind of transformative impact that they did in the past  when history takes a look back at great inventions like the car and transistor  they were defining technologies which ultimately changed people s lives substantially  but  says nick donofrio  senior vice president of technology and manufacturing at ibm  it was not  the thing  itself that actually improved people s lives  it was all the social and cultural changes that the discovery or invention brought with it  the car brought about a crucial change to how people lived in cities  giving them the ability to move out into the suburbs  whilst having mobility and access   when we talk about innovation and creating real value in the 21st century  we have to think more like this  but faster   mr donofrio told the bbc news website  after giving the royal academy of engineering 2004 hinton lecture   the invention  discovery is likely not to have the same value as the transistor had or the automobile had   the equivalent of those things will be invented or discovered  but by themselves  they are just not going to able to generate real business value or wealth as these things did   these are not altogether new ideas  and academics have been exploring how technologies impact wider society for years  but what it means for technology companies is that a new idea  method  or device  will have to have a different kind thinking behind it so that people see the value that innovative technology has for them  we are in a different phase now when it comes to technology  argues mr donofrio  industry week s 2003 technology leader of the year  the hype and over promise is over and now technology leaders have to demonstrate that things work  make sense  make a difference and life gets better as a result   in the dotcom era  there was something that was jumping up in your face every five minutes   somebody had a new thing that would awe you  you weren t quite sure that it did anything  you weren t quite sure if you needed it  you weren t quite sure if it had value for it  but it was cool   but change and innovation in technology that people will see affecting their daily lives,news article

charles kennedy is far too canny to make any grand claims about how his party may fare at the general election  in his 22 years in the commons  he has seen his fair share of such claims dashed on the rocks of bitter experience and  he might say  the uk s political and electoral system  but even his caution cannot hide the fact that this is a party and a leader that believes it may well be on the way to something special in a few months  time   look  i have already said i am not going to put any artificial limits on our ambitions this time around   he said  he still seems to accept that the most likely outcome is another labour victory of some sort  and his general election pitch is designed around the notion of the lib dems as the  real  opposition  but doesn t that lead to the jibe that his is a party actively bidding to come second  he is prepared to go this far   a clear conclusion has been reached  including by conservatives  that the conservatives are not going to win this election   therefore the potential is there for the liberal democrat advance to be one of the big stories of the election  given that we have the capacity to take on labour and win as well as take on the conservatives and win   this is really going to be the first modern three party uk election that we have all experienced   but haven t we been here before  with suggestions in the 1980s that labour was finished  won t voters looking for an alternative to labour still naturally gravitate to the conservatives   the problem is that  geographically  the conservative party has melted away in about a third of britain   we have supplanted them as the main alternative to labour in whole tracts of mainland britain  and they are a party with an ageing and declining membership base and they just do not look vibrant or vital or in touch any longer with contemporary britain   mr kennedy is also eager to dispel any impression his party is the new party of the left and is likely to attract mostly disillusioned labour voters  he insists his three headline commitments  to be financed from a 1  tax increase on those earning over £100 000 a year  will appeal right across the political spectrum  they are to replace the council tax w,news article

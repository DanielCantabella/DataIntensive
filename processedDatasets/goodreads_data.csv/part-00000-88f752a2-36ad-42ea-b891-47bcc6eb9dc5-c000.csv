the misanthrope or le misanthrope ou l’atrabilaire amoureux is a comedy of manners in five acts and in verse it is one of the best of molière s plays — and one of the greatest of all comedies — spotlighting the absurdities of social and literary pretension  focusing on a man who is quick to criticize the faults of others  yet remains blind to his own this play satirizes the hypocrisies of french aristocratic society  but it also engages a more serious tone when pointing out the flaws  which all humans possess  the play differs from other farces at the time by employing dynamic characters like alceste and célimène as opposed to the traditionally flat characters used by most satirists to criticize problems in society  it also differs from most of molière s other works by focusing more on character development and nuances than on plot progression  the play  though not a commercial success in its time  survives as molière s best known work today  much of its universal appeal is due to common undercurrents of misanthropy across cultural borders

do we imagine english history as a book with white pages and no black letters in  we sometimes think of tudor england in terms of gaudy costumes  the court of henry viii and elizabeth i and perhaps shakespearian romance  onyeka s book acknowledges this predilection but challenges our perceptions  onyeka s book is about the presence  status and origins of africans in tudor england  in it onyeka argues that these people were present in cities and towns throughout england  but that they did not automatically occupy the lowest positions in tudor society  this is important because the few modern historians who have written about africans in tudor england suggest that they were all slaves  or transient immigrants who were considered as dangerous strangers and the epitome of otherness  however  this book will show that some africans in england had important occupations in tudor society  and were employed by powerful people because of the skills they possessed  these people seem to have inherited some of their skills from the multicultural societies that they came from  but that does not mean all of those present in england were born in other countries  some were born in england  the arguments in this book are supported by evidence from a variety of sources both manuscript and printed  most of which has not been widely discussed   whilst some of it onyeka has discovered  and this may be the first time that it has been revealed  other evidence is taken from texts that are the subject of popular discussion by historians  linguists and so on  but onyeka encourages the reader to re examine these works in a different way because they reveal information about the presence  status and origins of africans in tudor england

nate silver built an innovative system for predicting baseball performance  predicted the 2008 election within a hair s breadth  he solidified his standing as the nation s foremost political forecaster with his near perfect prediction of the 2012 election  silver is the founder and editor in chief of fivethirtyeight com  drawing on his own groundbreaking work  silver examines the world of prediction  investigating how we can distinguish a true signal from a universe of noisy data  most predictions fail  often at great cost to society  because most of us have a poor understanding of probability and uncertainty  both experts and laypeople mistake more confident predictions for more accurate ones  but overconfidence is often the reason for failure  if our appreciation of uncertainty improves  our predictions can get better too  this is the  prediction paradox   the more humility we have about our ability to make predictions  the more successful we can be in planning for the future in keeping with his own aim to seek truth from data  silver visits the most successful forecasters in a range of areas  from hurricanes to baseball  from the poker table to the stock market  from capitol hill to the nba  he explains and evaluates how these forecasters think and what bonds they share  what lies behind their success  are they good or just lucky  what patterns have they unraveled  and are their forecasts really right  he explores unanticipated commonalities and exposes unexpected juxtapositions  and sometimes  it is not so much how good a prediction is in an absolute sense that matters but how good it is relative to the competition  in other cases  prediction is still a very rudimentary and dangerous science silver observes that the most accurate forecasters tend to have a superior command of probability  and they tend to be both humble and hardworking  they distinguish the predictable from the unpredictable  and they notice a thousand little details that lead them closer to the truth  because of their appreciation of probability  they can distinguish the signal from the noise

from the internationally bestselling author of no god but god comes a fascinating  provocative  and meticulously researched biography that challenges long held assumptions about the man we know as jesus of nazareth  two thousand years ago  an itinerant jewish preacher and miracle worker walked across the galilee  gathering followers to establish what he called the “kingdom of god ” the revolutionary movement he launched was so threatening to the established order that he was captured  tortured  and executed as a state criminal  within decades after his shameful death  his followers would call him god  sifting through centuries of mythmaking  reza aslan sheds new light on one of history’s most influential and enigmatic characters by examining jesus through the lens of the tumultuous era in which he lived  first century palestine  an age awash in apocalyptic fervor  scores of jewish prophets  preachers  and would be messiahs wandered through the holy land  bearing messages from god  this was the age of zealotry—a fervent nationalism that made resistance to the roman occupation a sacred duty incumbent on all jews  and few figures better exemplified this principle than the charismatic galilean who defied both the imperial authorities and their allies in the jewish religious hierarchy  balancing the jesus of the gospels against the historical sources  aslan describes a man full of conviction and passion  yet rife with contradiction  a man of peace who exhorted his followers to arm themselves with swords  an exorcist and faith healer who urged his disciples to keep his identity a secret  and ultimately the seditious “king of the jews” whose promise of liberation from rome went unfulfilled in his brief lifetime  aslan explores the reasons why the early christian church preferred to promulgate an image of jesus as a peaceful spiritual teacher rather than a politically conscious revolutionary  and he grapples with the riddle of how jesus understood himself  the mystery that is at the heart of all subsequent claims about his divinity  zealot yields a fresh perspective on one of the greatest stories ever told even as it affirms the radical and transformative nature of jesus of nazareth’s life and mission  the result is a thought provoking  elegantly written biography with the pulse

widely regarded as sadegh hedayat s masterpiece  the blind owl is the most important work of literature to come out of iran in the past century  on the surface this work seems to be a tale of doomed love  but with the turning of each page basic facts become obscure and the reader soon realizes this book is much more than a love story  although the blind owl has been compared to the works of the kafka  rilke and poe  this work defies categorization  lescot s french translation made the blind owl world famous  while d p  costello s english translation made it largely accessible  sadly  this work has yet to find its way into the english pantheon of classics  this 75th anniversary edition  translated by award winning writer naveed noori and published in conjunction with the hedayat foundation  aims to change this and is notable for a number of firsts   the only translation endorsed by the sadegh hedayat foundation  the first translation to use the definitive bombay edition  hedayat s handwritten text   the only available english translation by a native persian and english speaker  the preface includes a detailed textual analysis of the blind owl finally  by largely preserving the spirit as well as the structure of hedayat s writing  this edition brings the english reader into the world of the hedayat s blind owl as never before  extensive footnotes  explaining persian words  phrases  and customs ignored in previous translations  provide deeper understanding of this work for both the causal reader and the serious student of literature       there are indeed marked differences between costello s and noori s translations  as noori indicates  his attempt to preserve the overabundance of dashes gives the reader a more immediate sense of the narrator s agitation   the first sentence flows on in noori s translation  piling sensation upon sensation never allowing us to pause and catch our breath or separate out the images from the sensations  in his discussion of the relationship between his translation and costello s  noori also draws on translation theory and sees costello s focus on the fluidity of the text in english as a  domestication  of hedayat s original  noori s new english translation and his preface are a welcome addition and will no doubt draw the attention of scholars i

most of us spend our lives wrestling with day to day questions of right and wrong and these either unanswered or have no easy answer  this book turns to the sanskrit epic  mahabharata  in order to answer the question  ‘why be good ’ and it discovers that the epic’s world of moral haziness and uncertainty is closer to our experience as ordinary human beings rather than the narrow and rigid positions that define most debate and discussion today after 9 11 the mahabharata is obsessed with the elusive notion of dharma—in essence  doing the right thing  when a hero does something wrong in a greek epic  he gets on with it  when a hero falters in the mahabharata  the action stops and everyone weighs in with a different and contradictory take on dharma  the epic’s characters are flawed  they stumble  but their incoherent experiences throw light on our day to day emotions of envy  revenge  remorse  status anxiety  compassion  courage  duty and other moral qualities  as the mahabharata’s story unfolds in each chapter  and the author lets the epic speak as far as possible   the focus moves to a single character and his or her ethical problem–and its significance for our lives

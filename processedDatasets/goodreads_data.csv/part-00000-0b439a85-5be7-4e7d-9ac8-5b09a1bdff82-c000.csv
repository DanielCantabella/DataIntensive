when stephen covey first released the seven habits of highly effective people  the book became an instant rage because people suddenly got up and took notice that their lives were headed off in the wrong direction  and more than that  they realized that there were so many simple things they could do in order to navigate their life correctly  this book was wonderful education for people  education in how to live life effectively and get closer to the ideal of being a ‘success’ in life but not everyone understands stephen covey’s model fully well  or maybe there are some people who haven’t read it yet  this is definitely true because we still see so much failure all around us  now  i am not saying that by using covey’s model  or anyone else’s model for that matter  you can become a sure shot success  but at least we should have seen many more successes around us already judging by the number of copies the book has sold  so  where is the shortcoming there are two main problems here  and we are talking only about the people who have read the book already  the first problem is that most people are too lazy to implement the ideals of stephen covey in their lives  they consider his masterpiece of a book as a mere coffee table book or a book that you use for light reading when you are traveling and then forget all about it  they do not realize that this book contains life changing information  or  they take the information and do not make the effort to actually utilize it so that it becomes knowledge for them the second problem is that a lot of people have a myopic view of covey’s ideals  these are people who are impressed by the book already  if you ask them what the seven habits are  they can rattle them off end to end  but then they miss the larger picture  they do not understand that covey was trying to tell more than he wrote in words  there are hidden implications in this book  yes  and a lot of people have just failed to see through them that is what we are trying to do  we are trying to show you how covey’s book  or rather  his model  was a complete model in itself  there was nothing amiss about it  if you implement it  there should be no aspect of your life that should go untouched  the only thing is that you have to understand

the former head of the sante fe institute  visionary physicist geoffrey west is a pioneer in the field of complexity science  the science of emergent systems and networks  the term “complexity” can be misleading  however  because what makes west’s discoveries so beautiful is that he has found an underlying simplicity that unites the seemingly complex and diverse phenomena of living systems  including our bodies  our cities and our businesses  fascinated by issues of aging and mortality  west applied the rigor of a physicist to the biological question of why we live as long as we do and no longer  the result was astonishing  and changed science  creating a new understanding of energy use and metabolism  west found that despite the riotous diversity in the sizes of mammals  they are all  to a large degree  scaled versions of each other  if you know the size of a mammal  you can use scaling laws to learn everything from how much food it eats per day  what its heart rate is  how long it will take to mature  its lifespan  and so on  furthermore  the efficiency of the mammal’s circulatory systems scales up precisely based on weight  if you compare a mouse  a human and an elephant on a logarithmic graph  you find with every doubling of average weight  a species gets 25  more efficient—and lives 25  longer  this speaks to everything from how long we can expect to live to how many hours of sleep we need  fundamentally  he has proven  the issue has to do with the fractal geometry of the networks that supply energy and remove waste from the organism s body  west s work has been game changing for biologists  but then he made the even bolder move of exploring his work s applicability to cities  cities  too  are constellations of networks and laws of scalability relate with eerie precision to them  for every doubling in a city s size  the city needs 15  less road  electrical wire  and gas stations to support the same population  more amazingly  for every doubling in size  cities produce 15  more patents and more wealth  as well as 15  more crime and disease  this broad pattern lays the groundwork for a new science of cities  recently  west has applied his revolutionary work on cities and biological life to the business world  this investigatio

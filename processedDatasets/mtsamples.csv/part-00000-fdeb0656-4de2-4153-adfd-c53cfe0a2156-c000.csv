concomitant chemoradiotherapy for curative intent patients this patient is receiving combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy in an effort to maximize the chance of control of this cancer  the chemotherapy is given in addition to the radiotherapy  not only to act as a cytotoxic agent on its own  but also to potentiate and enhance the effect of radiotherapy on tumor cells  it has been shown in the literature that this will maximize the chance of control  during the course of the treatment  the patient s therapy must be closely monitored by the attending physician to be sure that the proper chemotherapy drugs are given at the proper time during the radiotherapy course  it is also important to closely monitor the patient to know when treatment with either chemotherapy or radiotherapy needs to be held  this combined treatment usually produces greater side effects than either treatment alone  and these need to be constantly monitored and treatment initiated on a timely basis to minimize these effects  in accordance  this requires more frequency consultation and coordination with the medical oncologist  therefore  this becomes a very time intensive treatment and justifies cpt code 77470

xyz  m d   suite 123  abc avenue  city  state 12345  re  xxxx  xxxx  mr   0000000 dear dr  xyz   xxxx was seen in followup in the pediatric urology clinic  i appreciate you speaking with me while he was in clinic  he continues to have abdominal pain  and he had a diuretic renal scan  which indicates no evidence of obstruction and good differential function bilaterally   when i examined him  he seems to indicate that his pain is essentially in the lower abdomen in the suprapubic region  however  on actual physical examination  he seems to complain of pain through his entire right side  his parents have brought up the question of whether this could be gastrointestinal in origin and that is certainly an appropriate consideration  they also feel that since he has been on detrol  his pain levels have been somewhat worse  and so  i have given them the option of stopping the detrol initially  i think he should stay on miralax for management of his bowels  i would also suggest that he be referred to pediatric gastroenterology for evaluation  if they do not find any abnormalities from a gastrointestinal perspective  then the next step would be to endoscope his bladder and then make sure that he does not have any evidence of bladder anatomic abnormalities that is leading to this pain   thank you for following xxxx along with us in pediatric urology clinic  if you have any questions  please feel free to contact me   sincerely yours

doctor s address dear doctor  this letter is an introduction to my patient  a  who you will be seeing in the near future  he is a pleasant gentleman with a history of wilson s disease  it has been treated with penicillamine  he was diagnosed with this at age 14  he was on his way to south carolina for a trip when he developed shortness of breath  palpitations  and chest discomfort  he went to the closest hospital that they were near in randolph  north carolina and he was found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid rate  he was admitted there and observed  he converted to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously and so he required no further interventions  he was started on lopressor  which he has tolerated well  an echocardiogram was performed  which revealed mild to moderate left atrial enlargement  normal ejection fraction  no other significant valvular abnormality  he reported to physicians there that he had cirrhosis related to his wilson s disease  therefore hepatologist was consulted  there was a recommendation to avoid coumadin secondary to his questionable significant liver disease  therefore he was placed on aspirin 325 mg once a day  in discussion with mr  a and review of his chart that i have available  it is unclear as to the status of his liver disease  however  he has never had a liver biopsy  so his diagnosis of cirrhosis that they were concerned about in north carolina is in doubt  his lfts have remained normal and his copper level has been undetectable on his current dose of penicillamine  i would appreciate your input into the long term management of his anticoagulation and also any recommendations you would have about rhythm control  he is in normal sinus rhythm as of my evaluation of him on 06 12 2008  he is tolerating his metoprolol and aspirin without any difficulty  i guess the big question remains is what level of risk that is entailed by placing him on coumadin therapy due to his potentially paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and evidence of left atrial enlargement that would place him in increased risk of recurrent episodes  i appreciate your input regarding this friendly gentleman  his current medicines include penicillamine 250 mg p o  four times a day  metoprolol 12 5 mg twice a day  and aspirin 325 mg a day

reason for visit    this is a new patient evaluation for mr  a  there is a malignant meningioma  he is referred by dr  x  history of present illness    he said he has had two surgeries in 07 06 followed by radiation and then again in 08 07  he then had a problem with seizures  hemiparesis  has been to the hospital  developed c diff  and is in the nursing home currently  he is unable to stand at the moment  he is unable to care for himself   i reviewed the information that was sent down with him from the nursing home which includes his medical history  medications   keppra 1500 twice a day and decadron 6 mg four times a day  his other medicines include oxycodone  an aspirin a day  prilosec  dilantin 300 a day  and flagyl  findings   on examination  he is lying on the stretcher  he has oxygen on and has periods of spontaneous hyperventilation  he is unable to lift his right arm or right leg  he has an expressive dysphasia and confusion  i reviewed the imaging studies from summer from the beginning of 10 07  end of 10 07 as well as the current mri he had last week  this shows that he has had progression of disease with recurrence along the surface of the brain and there is significant brain edema  this is a malignant meningioma by diagnosis  assessment plan    in summary  mr  a has significant disability and is not independent currently  i believe that because of this that the likelihood of benefit from surgery is small and there is a very good chance that he would not be able to recover from surgery  i do not think that surgery will help his quality of life and a need to control the tumor would be dependent on another therapy impacting the tumor  given that there are not good therapies and chemotherapy would be the option at the moment  and he certainly is not in a condition where chemotherapy would be given  i believe that surgery would not be in his best interest  i discussed this both with him  although it is not clear to me how much he understood  as well as his family

history   this is a digital eeg performed on a 75 year old male with seizures  background activity   the background activity consists of a 8 hz to 9 hz rhythm arising in the posterior head region  this rhythm is also accompanied by some beta activity which occurs infrequently  there are also muscle contractions occurring at 4 hz to 5 hz which suggests possible parkinson s  part of the eeg is obscured by the muscle contraction artifact  there are also left temporal sharps occurring infrequently during the tracing  at one point of time  there was some slowing occurring in the right frontal head region  activation procedures   photic stimulation was performed and did not show any significant abnormality  sleep patterns   no sleep architecture was observed during this tracing  impression   this awake alert drowsy eeg is abnormal due to the presence of slowing in the right frontal head region  due to the presence of sharps arising in the left temporal head region  and due to the tremors  the slowing can be consistent with underlying structural abnormalities  so a stroke  subdural hematoma  etc   should be ruled out  the tremor probably represents a parkinson s tremor and the sharps arising in the left temporal head region can potentially give way to seizures or may also represent underlying structural abnormalities  so clinical correlation is recommended

xyz re  abc medical record   123 dear dr  xyz  i saw abc back in neuro oncology clinic today  he comes in for an urgent visit because of increasing questions about what to do next for his anaplastic astrocytoma  within the last several days  he has seen you in clinic and once again discussed whether or not to undergo radiation for his left temporal lesion  the patient has clearly been extremely ambivalent about this therapy for reasons that are not immediately apparent  it is clear that his mri is progressing and that it seems unlikely at this time that anything other than radiation would be particularly effective  despite repeatedly emphasizing this  however  the patient still is worried about potential long term side effects from treatment that frankly seem unwarranted at this particular time  after seeing you in clinic  he and his friend again wanted to discuss possible changes in the chemotherapy regimen  they came in with a list of eight possible agents that they would like to be administered within the next two weeks  they then wanted another mri to be performed and they were hoping that with the use of this type of approach  they might be able to induce another remission from which he can once again be spared radiation  from my view  i noticed a man whose language has deteriorated in the week since i last saw him  this is very worrisome  today  for the first time  i felt that there was a definite right facial droop as well  therefore  there is no doubt that he is becoming symptomatic from his growing tumor  it suggests that he is approaching the end of his compliance curve and that the things may rapidly deteriorate in the near future  emphasizing this once again  in addition  to recommending steroids i once again tried to convince him to undergo radiation  despite an hour  this again amazingly was not possible  it is not that he does not want treatment  however  because i told him that i did not feel it was ethical to just put him on the radical regimen that him and his friend devised  we compromised and elected to go back to temodar in a low dose daily type regimen  we would plan on giving 75 mg sq m everyday for 21 days out of 28 days  in addition  we will stop thalidomide 100 mg day  if he tolerates this for one week

xyz  m d   suite 123  abc avenue  city  state 12345  re  xxxx  xxxx  mr   0000000 dear dr  xyz   xxxx was seen in followup in the pediatric urology clinic  i appreciate you speaking with me while he was in clinic  he continues to have abdominal pain  and he had a diuretic renal scan  which indicates no evidence of obstruction and good differential function bilaterally   when i examined him  he seems to indicate that his pain is essentially in the lower abdomen in the suprapubic region  however  on actual physical examination  he seems to complain of pain through his entire right side  his parents have brought up the question of whether this could be gastrointestinal in origin and that is certainly an appropriate consideration  they also feel that since he has been on detrol  his pain levels have been somewhat worse  and so  i have given them the option of stopping the detrol initially  i think he should stay on miralax for management of his bowels  i would also suggest that he be referred to pediatric gastroenterology for evaluation  if they do not find any abnormalities from a gastrointestinal perspective  then the next step would be to endoscope his bladder and then make sure that he does not have any evidence of bladder anatomic abnormalities that is leading to this pain   thank you for following xxxx along with us in pediatric urology clinic  if you have any questions  please feel free to contact me   sincerely yours
sample address re  sample patient wife s name  sample name dear sample doctor  mr  sample patient was seen on month dd  yyyy  describing a vasectomy 10 years ago and a failed vasectomy reversal done almost two years ago at the university of michigan  he has remained azoospermic postoperatively  the operative note suggests the presence of some sperm and sperm head on the right side at the time of the vasectomy reversal  he states that he is interested in sperm harvesting and cryopreservation prior to the next attempted ovulation induction for his wife  apparently  several attempts at induction have been tried and due to some anatomic abnormality  they have been unsuccessful  at the time that he left the office  he was asking for cryopreservation  at the time of sperm harvesting  i recently received a phone call suggesting that he does not want to do this at all unless his wife s ovulation has been confirmed and it appears then that he may be interested in a fresh specimen harvest  i look forward to hearing from you regarding the actual plan so that we can arrange our procedure appropriately  at his initial request  month dd  yyyy was picked as the date for scheduled harvesting  although this may change if you require fresh specimen  thank you very much for the opportunity to have seen him  sample doctor  m d
doctor s address dear doctor  this letter is an introduction to my patient  a  who you will be seeing in the near future  he is a pleasant gentleman with a history of wilson s disease  it has been treated with penicillamine  he was diagnosed with this at age 14  he was on his way to south carolina for a trip when he developed shortness of breath  palpitations  and chest discomfort  he went to the closest hospital that they were near in randolph  north carolina and he was found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid rate  he was admitted there and observed  he converted to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously and so he required no further interventions  he was started on lopressor  which he has tolerated well  an echocardiogram was performed  which revealed mild to moderate left atrial enlargement  normal ejection fraction  no other significant valvular abnormality  he reported to physicians there that he had cirrhosis related to his wilson s disease  therefore hepatologist was consulted  there was a recommendation to avoid coumadin secondary to his questionable significant liver disease  therefore he was placed on aspirin 325 mg once a day  in discussion with mr  a and review of his chart that i have available  it is unclear as to the status of his liver disease  however  he has never had a liver biopsy  so his diagnosis of cirrhosis that they were concerned about in north carolina is in doubt  his lfts have remained normal and his copper level has been undetectable on his current dose of penicillamine  i would appreciate your input into the long term management of his anticoagulation and also any recommendations you would have about rhythm control  he is in normal sinus rhythm as of my evaluation of him on 06 12 2008  he is tolerating his metoprolol and aspirin without any difficulty  i guess the big question remains is what level of risk that is entailed by placing him on coumadin therapy due to his potentially paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and evidence of left atrial enlargement that would place him in increased risk of recurrent episodes  i appreciate your input regarding this friendly gentleman  his current medicines include penicillamine 250 mg p o  four times a day  metoprolol 12 5 mg twice a day  and aspirin 325 mg a day

xyz re  abc medical record   123 dear dr  xyz  i saw abc back in neuro oncology clinic today  he comes in for an urgent visit because of increasing questions about what to do next for his anaplastic astrocytoma  within the last several days  he has seen you in clinic and once again discussed whether or not to undergo radiation for his left temporal lesion  the patient has clearly been extremely ambivalent about this therapy for reasons that are not immediately apparent  it is clear that his mri is progressing and that it seems unlikely at this time that anything other than radiation would be particularly effective  despite repeatedly emphasizing this  however  the patient still is worried about potential long term side effects from treatment that frankly seem unwarranted at this particular time  after seeing you in clinic  he and his friend again wanted to discuss possible changes in the chemotherapy regimen  they came in with a list of eight possible agents that they would like to be administered within the next two weeks  they then wanted another mri to be performed and they were hoping that with the use of this type of approach  they might be able to induce another remission from which he can once again be spared radiation  from my view  i noticed a man whose language has deteriorated in the week since i last saw him  this is very worrisome  today  for the first time  i felt that there was a definite right facial droop as well  therefore  there is no doubt that he is becoming symptomatic from his growing tumor  it suggests that he is approaching the end of his compliance curve and that the things may rapidly deteriorate in the near future  emphasizing this once again  in addition  to recommending steroids i once again tried to convince him to undergo radiation  despite an hour  this again amazingly was not possible  it is not that he does not want treatment  however  because i told him that i did not feel it was ethical to just put him on the radical regimen that him and his friend devised  we compromised and elected to go back to temodar in a low dose daily type regimen  we would plan on giving 75 mg sq m everyday for 21 days out of 28 days  in addition  we will stop thalidomide 100 mg day  if he tolerates this for one week
abnormal cholesterol result letter recently you had a cholesterol test done  the cholesterol levels were abnormal  these are usually associated with increased risk for stroke and heart attack  i am writing this letter to you to let you know that your levels are high enough that i think intervention is the next best step  i would like you to make an appointment  if you are interested in treatment for this  there are several treatment options available at this time  diet is one of the options  although there is limited reduction in total cholesterol and ldl cholesterol with dieting  most of the time under strict diet patients can achieve a 15  reduction in cholesterol  if your cholesterol levels are moderate to severely elevated  usually diet is not the first line of therapy  if you are diabetic or have hypertension these two also increase your risk with the combination of hypercholesterolemia  most of the time cholesterol that is elevated is from your genetic background and is independent of diet  new research shows that treatment of high cholesterol can decrease your risk of developing alzheimer’s disease  again  i am recommending at least we discuss medical treatment for hypercholesterolemia  please consider calling for a followup appointment concerning your cholesterol levels  if you should have any further questions  please do not hesitate to contact me  i am enclosing a copy of your lab results for your review

bnp   brain natriuretic peptide or b type natriuretic peptide  is a substance produced in the heart ventricles when there is excessive strain to the heart muscles  a blood test for this can be used as an effective parameter for detecting an acute event of congestive heart failure  where the heart is unable to pump sufficient amount of blood required by the body s needs  when a person has a heart failure  such as mi   bnp is secreted so immensely that it sits well above the measurable range  values above 100 signal a problematic situation and those above 500 a highly demanding state  note that a person with a remote history of heart problems may not have bnp levels elevated  but it is used as a measure of acute events  on the other hand   bmp  or basic metabolic panel is not a single test but a group of 8 tests  glucose  calcium  sodium  potassium  bicarbonate  chloride  bun  creatinine   any test that has the word panel in it is not a single test  so cannot have a single value  with this logic in mind  if a doctor uses phrases like   bnp bmp is elevated negative positive is greater than less than etc    and then a single value

preoperative diagnosis    right upper eyelid squamous cell carcinoma  postoperative diagnosis    right upper eyelid squamous cell carcinoma  procedure performed    excision of right upper eyelid squamous cell carcinoma with frozen section and full thickness skin grafting from the opposite eyelid  complications   none  blood loss    minimal  anesthesia   local with sedation  indication   the patient is a 65 year old male with a large squamous cell carcinoma on his right upper eyelid  which had previous radiation  description of procedure    the patient was taken to the operating room  laid supine  administered intravenous sedation  and prepped and draped in a sterile fashion  he was anesthetized with a combination of 2  lidocaine and 0 5  marcaine with epinephrine on both upper eyelids  the area of obvious scar tissue from the radiation for the squamous cell carcinoma on the right upper eyelid was completely excised down to the eyelid margin including resection of a few of the upper eye lashes  this was extended essentially from the punctum to the lateral commissure and extended up on to the upper eyelid  the resection was carried down through the orbicularis muscle resecting the pretarsal orbicularis muscle and the inferior portion of the preseptal orbicularis muscle leaving the tarsus intact and leaving the orbital septum intact  following complete resection  the patient was easily able to open and close his eyes as the levator muscle insertion was left intact to the tarsal plate  the specimen was sent to pathology  which revealed only fibrotic tissue and no evidence of any residual squamous cell carcinoma  meticulous hemostasis was obtained with bovie cautery and a full thickness skin graft was taken from the opposite upper eyelid in a fashion similar to a blepharoplasty of the appropriate size for the defect in the right upper eyelid  the left upper eyelid incision was closed with 6 0 fast absorbing gut interrupted sutures  and the skin graft was sutured in place with 6 0 fast absorbing gut interrupted sutures  an eye patch was placed on the right side  and the patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to pacu in good condition
concomitant chemoradiotherapy for curative intent patients this patient is receiving combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy in an effort to maximize the chance of control of this cancer  the chemotherapy is given in addition to the radiotherapy  not only to act as a cytotoxic agent on its own  but also to potentiate and enhance the effect of radiotherapy on tumor cells  it has been shown in the literature that this will maximize the chance of control  during the course of the treatment  the patient s therapy must be closely monitored by the attending physician to be sure that the proper chemotherapy drugs are given at the proper time during the radiotherapy course  it is also important to closely monitor the patient to know when treatment with either chemotherapy or radiotherapy needs to be held  this combined treatment usually produces greater side effects than either treatment alone  and these need to be constantly monitored and treatment initiated on a timely basis to minimize these effects  in accordance  this requires more frequency consultation and coordination with the medical oncologist  therefore  this becomes a very time intensive treatment and justifies cpt code 77470
conformal simulation with coplanar beams this patient is undergoing a conformal simulation as the method to precisely define the area of disease which needs to be treated  it allows us to highly focus the beam of radiation and shape the beam to the target volume  delivering a homogenous dosage through it while sparing the surrounding  more radiosensitive  normal tissues  this will allow us to give the optimum chance of tumor control while minimizing the acute and long term side effects  a conformal simulation is a simulation which involves extended physician  therapist  and dosimetrist time and effort  the patient is initially taken into a conventional simulator room  where appropriate markers are placed  and the patient is positioned and immobilized  one then approximates the field sizes and arrangements  gantry angles  collimator angles  and number of fields   radiographs are taken  and these fields are marked on the patient s skin  the patient is then transferred to the diagnostic facility and placed on a flat ct scan table  scans are then performed through the targeted area  the ct scans are evaluated by the radiation oncologist  and the tumor volume  target volume  and critical structures are outlined on each slice of the ct scan  the dosimetrist then evaluates each individual slice in the treatment planning computer with the appropriately marked structures  this volume is then reconstructed in 3 dimensional space  utilizing the beam s eye view features  the appropriate blocks are designed  multiplane computerized dosimetry is performed throughout the volume  field arrangements and blocking are modified as necessary to provide homogenous coverage of the target volume while minimizing the dose to normal structures  once all appropriate beam parameters and isodate distributions have been confirmed on the computer scan  each individual slice is then reviewed by the physician  the beam s eye view  block design  and appropriate volumes are also printed and reviewed by the physician  once these are approved  cerrobend blocks will be custom fabricated  if significant changes are made in the field arrangements from the original simulation  the patient is brought back to the simulator where the computer designed fields are re simulat

xyz re  abc medical record   123 dear dr  xyz  i saw abc back in neuro oncology clinic today  he comes in for an urgent visit because of increasing questions about what to do next for his anaplastic astrocytoma  within the last several days  he has seen you in clinic and once again discussed whether or not to undergo radiation for his left temporal lesion  the patient has clearly been extremely ambivalent about this therapy for reasons that are not immediately apparent  it is clear that his mri is progressing and that it seems unlikely at this time that anything other than radiation would be particularly effective  despite repeatedly emphasizing this  however  the patient still is worried about potential long term side effects from treatment that frankly seem unwarranted at this particular time  after seeing you in clinic  he and his friend again wanted to discuss possible changes in the chemotherapy regimen  they came in with a list of eight possible agents that they would like to be administered within the next two weeks  they then wanted another mri to be performed and they were hoping that with the use of this type of approach  they might be able to induce another remission from which he can once again be spared radiation  from my view  i noticed a man whose language has deteriorated in the week since i last saw him  this is very worrisome  today  for the first time  i felt that there was a definite right facial droop as well  therefore  there is no doubt that he is becoming symptomatic from his growing tumor  it suggests that he is approaching the end of his compliance curve and that the things may rapidly deteriorate in the near future  emphasizing this once again  in addition  to recommending steroids i once again tried to convince him to undergo radiation  despite an hour  this again amazingly was not possible  it is not that he does not want treatment  however  because i told him that i did not feel it was ethical to just put him on the radical regimen that him and his friend devised  we compromised and elected to go back to temodar in a low dose daily type regimen  we would plan on giving 75 mg sq m everyday for 21 days out of 28 days  in addition  we will stop thalidomide 100 mg day  if he tolerates this for one week

chronic snoring chronic snoring in children can be associated with obstructive sleep apnea or upper airway resistant syndrome  both conditions may lead to sleep fragmentation and or intermittent oxygen desaturation  both of which have significant health implications including poor sleep quality and stress on the cardiovascular system  symptoms like daytime somnolence  fatigue  hyperactivity  behavior difficulty  i e   adhd  and decreased school performance have been reported with these conditions  in addition  the most severe cases may be associated with right ventricular hypertrophy  pulmonary and or systemic hypertension and even cor pulmonale  in this patient  the risks for a sleep disordered breathing include obesity and the tonsillar hypertrophy  it is therefore indicated and medically necessary to perform a polysomnogram for further evaluation  a two week sleep diary will be given to the parents to fill out daily before the polysomnogram is performed

reason for hospitalization   suspicious calcifications upper outer quadrant  left breast  history of present illness    the patient is a 78 year old woman who had undergone routine screening mammography on 06 04 08  that study disclosed the presence of punctate calcifications that were felt to be in a cluster distribution in the left breast mound at the 2 o clock position  additional imaging studies confirmed the suspicious nature of these calcifications  the patient underwent a stereotactic core needle biopsy of the left breast 2 o clock position on 06 17 08  the final histologic diagnosis of the tissue removed during that procedure revealed focal fibrosis  no calcifications could be identified in examination of the biopsy material including radiograph taken of the preserved tissue  two days post stereotactic core needle biopsy  however  the patient returned to the breast center with severe swelling and pain and mass in the left breast  she underwent sonographic evaluation and was found to have a development of false aneurysm formation at the site of stereotactic core needle biopsy  i was called to see the patient in the emergency consultation in the breast center  at the same time  dr  y was consulted in interventional radiology  dr  z and dr  y were able to identify the neck of the false aneurysm in the left breast mound and this was injected with ultrasound guidance with thrombin material  this resulted in immediate occlusion of the false aneurysm  the patient was seen in my office for followup appointment on 06 24 08  at that time  the patient continued to have signs of a large hematoma and extensive ecchymosis  which resulted from the stereotactic core needle biopsy  there was  however  no evidence of reforming of the false aneurysm  there was no evidence of any pulsatile mass in the left breast mound or on the left chest wall  i discussed the issues with the patient and her husband  the underlying problem is that the suspicious calcifications  which had been identified on mammography had not been adequately sampled with the stereotactic core needle biopsy  therefore  the histologic diagnosis is not explanatory of the imaging findings  for this reason  the patient was advised to have an excisional biopsy of this area with g

reason for visit    followup of laparoscopic fundoplication and gastrostomy  history of present illness    the patient is a delightful baby girl  who is now nearly 8 months of age and had a tracheostomy for subglottic stenosis  laparoscopic fundoplication and gastrostomy was done because of the need for enteral feeding access and to protect her airway at a time when it is either going to heal enough to improve and allow decannulation or eventually prove that she will need laryngotracheoplasty  dr  x is following the patient for this and currently plans are to perform a repeat endoscopic exam every couple of months to assist the status of her airway caliber  the patient had a laparoscopic fundoplication and gastrostomy on 10 05 2007  she has done well since that time  she has had some episodes of retching intermittently and these seemed to be unpredictable  she also had some diarrhea and poor feeding tolerance about a week ago but that has also resolved  the patient currently takes about 1 ounce to 1 5 ounce of her feedings by mouth and the rest is given by g tube  she seems otherwise happy and is not having an excessive amount of stools  her parents have not noted any significant problems with the gastrostomy site  the patient s exam today is excellent  her belly is soft and nontender  all of her laparoscopic trocar sites are healing with a normal amount of induration  but there is no evidence of hernia or infection  we removed the patient s gastrostomy button today and showed her parents how to reinsert one without difficulty  the site of the gastrostomy is excellent  there is not even a hint of granulation tissue or erythema  and i am very happy with the overall appearance  impression    the patient is doing exceptionally well status post laparoscope fundoplication and gastrostomy  hopefully  the exquisite control of acid reflux by fundoplication will help her airway heal  and if she does well  allow decannulation in the future  if she does require laryngotracheoplasty  the protection from acid reflux will be important to healing of that procedure as well  plan   the patient will follow up as needed for problems related to gastrostomy  we will see her when she comes in the hospital for endoscopic exams and possibly laryngotrach

parents often ask why the fluid cannot be drained without inserting a tube  the need for the tube insertion is because the eardrum incision generally heals very rapidly  within a few days   which is not long enough for the swollen membranes in the middle ear to return to normal  as soon as the eardrum heals  fluid will reaccumulate  tubes were first introduced because of this very problem  there are many types of tubes  but all tubes serve the same function  they keep the eardrum open  allow air to enter the middle ear space  and permit fluid in the middle ear to drain  most tubes will gradually be rejected by the ear and work their way out of the eardrum  as they come out  the eardrum seals behind the tube  tubes will last four to six months in the eardrum before they come out  occasionally  the eardrum does not heal completely when the tube comes out  the majority of children treated with tubes do not require further surgery  they may have ear infections in the future  but most will clear up with medical treatment  some children are very prone to ear infections and have a tendency to accumulate fluid after each infection  children tend to outgrow this cycle by age 7 or 8  in an ear  nose and throat specialty practice  this group comprises 10 to 15  of all children who have required tubes  occasionally the physician has to physically remove the tube from the ear drum
